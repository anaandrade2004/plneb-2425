                <p>This project focuses on the design and implementation of a multi-agent system (MAS) to monitor patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). The system leverages intelligent agents to interpret patients' vital signs, detect critical changes, and coordinate rapid responses to ensure timely and specialized medical care. The SPADE library is used to implement the agents in a distributed architecture, enabling real-time monitoring and efficient communication between agents. The system operates in a hospital setting, where critically ill patients are continuously monitored, and aims to improve patient outcomes by ensuring immediate and appropriate medical responses.</p>

                <p>This project involves the implementation of a genomic data analysis pipeline consisting of two main programs: converter and aggregator. The pipeline processes genomic data from multiple patients, converts DNA sequences to mRNA, and generates individual and aggregated statistics. The goal is to optimize the programs for efficiency, leveraging parallelism and memory management techniques to improve performance.</p>

                <p>This project focuses on the development of integrated healthcare management systems for Clinical Process Management (GPC) and Logistics and Medication Management (GLM). The goal is to create two separate but interconnected systems to ensure confidentiality of patient data while maintaining real-time updates of medication stocks. The systems are implemented using Django for the backend and HTML for the client interface, with REST APIs facilitating communication between the systems.</p>

                <p>The program is a data management and visualization tool designed to handle a dataset of individuals, offering a wide range of functionalities to interact with and analyze the data. Its central theme revolves around managing personal information and exploring patterns or distributions within the dataset. The program is built to be user-friendly, leveraging a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it accessible to users who may not have advanced technical skills. It is particularly useful for scenarios where managing and analyzing data about individuals—such as their personal details, preferences, and habits—is essential.</p>
