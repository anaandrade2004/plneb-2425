Variáveis independentes incluíram categorias de doenças, subcategorias,idade, sexo e níveis de PCR. A situação vital e data de morte foram determinadas pelo uso do Sistema de Prescrição Eléctrica português.Resultados:Uma VS superior a 100 mm/h foi determinada em 681 doentes (1,5% de todas as avaliações de VS). A categoria diagnóstica mais frequente foi infecção (461, 65,1%), seguida de neoplasia (107, 15,1%), e de inflamação/ autoimunidade (85, 12,0%). A doença mais prevalente foi a pneumonia (227, 33,3% de todos os doentes). A infeção era menos provável nos doentes de ambulatório (20,7%), assim como a neoplasia em mulheres (11,4%). A mortalidade a cinco anos foi de 70,3%, superior nos doentes com neoplasia (83%) e inferior nos doentes com inflamação/autoimunidade (45,9%).Conclusão:Verificámos que quase todos os doentes com elevação extrema da VS têm uma etiologia identificável, com infecção a ser a causa em cerca de dois terços e a pneumonia a ser responsável em cerca de um terço de todos os doentes. A infecção foi menos provável em doentes de ambulatório, assim como a neoplasia em mulheres. Os níveis de VS e de PCR têm fraca correlação nestes doentes. A mortalidade a cinco anos foi de 70,3%, com a sobrevida a ser significativamente menor em doentes com neoplasia, e superior em doentes com inflamação/autoimunidade. Estes resultados poderão auxiliar à avaliação diagnóstica e prognóstica dos doentes com elevações extremas da VS.",

Recentemente, tem sido proposta a abordagem de múltiplostreatable traitsno tratamento da doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica. Apesar da evidência da relação fisiopatológica entre as duas doenças, a literaturarelativa à diabetesmellituscomotreatable traitda doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica é escassa.Métodos:Realizou-se um estudo de coorte retrospetivo, que incluiu indivíduos com doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica, seguidos na Consulta Externa de Medicina Interna de um hospital universitário. Foram avaliados a presença de diabetesmellitus, o controlo glicémico e os outcomes da doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica.Resultados:Foram incluídos 279 doentes. A maioria (76,3%) era do sexo masculino, com média etária de 71,1 ± 9,5 anos. A prevalência da diabetesmellitusfoi 30,8%. A maioria dos doentes diabéticos (54,7%) apresentou bom controlo glicémico (HbA1c < 7%). A mediana de HbA1c foi 6,7% [1,0]. Não se verificou uma diferença estatisticamente significativa entre diabéticos e não diabéticos relativamente ao estadio da doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica, risco de exacerbação aguda de doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica a um ano, tempo de internamento por exacerbação aguda ou mortalidade a um ano.Conclusão: A prevalência e a incidência de diabetesmellitusnos doentes com doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica foram superiores em relação à população geral. Nesta população, verificou-se um bom controlo glicémico na maioria dos doentes e a diabetes não se associou a outcomes adversos na doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica. A diabetes deve ser considerada como treatable trait da doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica e o controlo glicémico deve ser um alvo terapêutico. A consulta externa de Medicina Interna desempenha um importante papel na abordagem integradora de que o doentecom doença pulmonar obstrutiva crónica beneficia.",

A apendicite, compreendida dentro deste conjunto de patologias, é a emergência abdominal cirúrgica mais frequente no mundo epode resultar em elevada mortalidade e morbilidade. Apesar do seu diagnóstico ser clínico, há alguns casos em que é difícil distinguir dos diferentes quadros de dor abdominal.O uso da ecografia no Serviço de Urgência tornou--se muito frequente, mas, considerando a problemática da potencial demora na realização deste exame e a condição crítica de alguns pacientes, é necessária uma abordagem focada e específica para os sintomas apresentados. Assimsendo, opoint-of-care ultrasound augmented clinical exam(PACE) tem assumido uma importância progressivamente maior, nomeadamente no abdómen agudo, visto permitir o reconhecimento e diagnóstico precoces e, consequentemente, a iniciação célere das medidas terapêuticas necessárias.Descrevemos o caso de uma paciente com abdómen agudo no qual o PACE, realizado por um profissional experiente, ajudou no diagnóstico de apendicite apesar dos restantes exames complementares de diagnóstico serem normais.",

Desconhece-se o impacto económico da IC na Região Autónoma da Madeira (RAM) pelo que é fundamental caracterizar a sua prevalência, perfil de utilização de recursos e custos associados.O nosso objetivo foi estimar os custos diretos da insuficiência cardíaca na Região Autónoma da Madeira.Métodos:Estudo custo-doença, baseado em prevalência,relativo ao ano 2014, e analisado na perspetiva do sistema de saúde regional. Os internamentos e a utilização da urgência foram identificados pela International Classification of Diseases 9th edition Clinical Modification (ICD-9CM). O número de consultas, exames e medicação foi estimado a partir da literatura. Os custos foram baseados na tabela de preços dos Grupos de Diagnósticos Homogéneos e na tabela de preços do Sistema Regional de Saúde.Resultados:Estimou-se uma prevalência de 4,93% (9201indivíduos) para uma população com idade superior a 25anos. Destes, 4140 sintomáticos e, portanto, consumidoresde recursos. Identificaram-se 426 internamentos por IC, 17305 consultas médicas de cuidados de saúde primários, 857episódios de urgência e 6707 consultas médicas hospitalares. O custo direto total foi €4 089 540,10. O custo em cuidados hospitalares (CH) foi a principal rubrica de custos (56%), seguido dos cuidados de saúde primários (23%) e consumo de medicamentos (20%). O custo médio anual por doente foi €987,81.Conclusão:O custo direto total corresponde a 0,1% doproduto interno bruto da RAM e 1,2% da despesa da saúdeda RAM para o ano de referência.

Contudo, a falta de evidência científica leva a que o seu tratamento seja bastante controverso, tornando imperativa a realização de mais estudos. Este estudo pretende avaliar a eficácia e a segurança das várias estratégias terapêuticasutilizadas na ateromatose complexa da aorta.Material e Métodos:Foi realizada uma análise retrospetivados doentes internados por AVC isquémico com diagnóstico de ateromatose complexa da aorta por ecocardiograma transesofágico, entre 1 de janeiro de 2010 e 31 de dezembro de 2022.Resultados:Dos 82 doentes incluídos, 23,2% apresentaramrecorrência de AVC isquémico, dos quais 47,4% estavammedicados com clopidogrel em monoterapia.

Cerca de 43% dos casos em Portugal são classificados como admissões não urgentes e pouco urgentes.Métodos:Este estudo observacional retrospetivo foi realizado no SUG de um hospital distrital de Portugal, de outubro de 2018 a maio de 2019. Foram incluídos adultos com prioridade verde e azul na triagem. O destino na alta e o número de admissões à urgência foram analisados, com associações examinadas em relação à idade, modo de proveniência, ativação de via azul e acesso a cuidados de saúde primários.Resultados:Incluímos 41 066 episódios, a maioria deles com prioridade verde (99,9%). A maioria dos doentes, 98,8%, teve alta para cuidados ambulatórios. Os frequent flyers (≥ 4 admissões) constituíam 3,3% dos doentes e os high users (≥ 10admissões) 0,3%. A análise mostrou associações significativas entre o destino à data de alta com a idade, com a proveniência e com a ativação da via azul (p<0,001). Houve ainda uma associação estatisticamente muito significativa entre o número de admissões e a idade (p<0,001) e o número de admissões e a capacidade de acesso aos CSP (p<0,001).Conclusão:O estudo destaca a importância de vários fatores no destino dos doentes, mostrando uma forte associação entre a idade e a probabilidade de internamento. Além disso, a forma de chegada ao SUG e a ativação da via azul também se associam com o destino do doente. No entanto, são necessários mais estudos para entender os problemas sistémicos do SUG.",

Ocorre uma absorção descontrolada do ferro e risco de sobrecarga a nível do fígado, coração, pâncreas, articulações e órgãos endócrinos. Os doentes estão em risco de evolução para cirrose e carcinoma hepático. Deve ser suspeitada na presença de sintomas, história familiar ou elevação dos marcadores séricos do ferro, em especial da saturação da transferrina. O diagnóstico é desafiante pela inespecificidade de manifestações clínicas e dos marcadores séricos do ferro. Há vários genes implicados,mas o HFE é o mais frequentemente afetado; a homozigotia C282Y associada a sobrecarga de ferro faz diagnóstico; outras variantes genéticas podem necessitar de estudo complementar com ressonância magnética ou biópsia hepática. O tratamento preferencial é a flebotomia, ou, em alternativa, eritrocitaferese ou quelação do ferro. Apresentam elevada morbimortalidade que pode ser reduzida com o início atempado do tratamento.",

John Tennent and João de Sequeira shared their European roots, the influence of boerhaavian medicine on their medicalpractice and the enthusiasm for the therapeutic properties of rattlesnake root. Tennent, on settling in Virginia, learnt how the Seneca used this root to cure rattlesnake bites and used it to treat respiratory diseases, particularly pleurisy and pneumonia; amazed with the good results, he disseminated his discovery in America and Europe, although generating some controversy in the medical community. Sequeira, a doctor with family origins in Brazil and a childhood marked by inquisitorial harassment, studied medicine in Leiden under the influence of the boerhaavian school; he ended up moving to Williamsburg, where he began to use rattlesnake root as an essential element in his daily medical practice, as he made clear in his notes on the diseases prevalent in Virginia. The focus on the properties of this plant in the treatment of a variety of pathologies is indicative of the valorization of indigenous medicine and the search for innovative therapeutic treatments at the time.",

The evolution of symptoms after the acute phase is still uncertain, as is their real impact.Methods: This prospective observational study began during the first phase of the pandemic in Portugal and sought to follow patients hospitalized with COVID-19 for two years after discharge, analyzing potential pulmonary sequelae. To date, there have been no similar studies in Portugal.Results: The study included 36 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between 1 March and 30 June 2020. Dyspnea was found to be the most prevalent and persistent respiratory symptom during follow-up. Regarding computed tomography changes, the most frequently described were ground glass and fibrotic changes, with improvement over one year of follow-up less evident in the case of fibrotic changes. Of particular note was the diagnosis of a case of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with COVID-19, a rare entity, but one that has already been described in the literature. Changes in echocardiograms or respiratory function tests were rarely documented.Conclusion: Given the small sample size, further prospective studies will be needed to clarify. The results reflect the difficulties encountered in carrying out research during the pandemic period, which conditioned the design and realization of the study, but which will certainly serve as an example and support in similar crises in the future.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have revolutionized the treatment of various medical conditions, including gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. Due to their affordability, widespread availability, and favourable safety profile, they are among the most commonly prescribed medications today. However, they are often prescribed without a valid medical reason, a practice that can be observed in up to 80% of cases.Methods: A retrospective study was conducted with theprimary objective of assessing the proportion of patients onPPIs and the presence or absence of a valid indication for their use. Additionally, we examined whether PPI usage had any impact on hospitalization duration and mortality. Finally, a brief cost analysis of these medications was performed. The study was carried out using a sample of patients admitted to a tertiary university hospital over nine months in internal medicine wards. Electronic records were consulted to collect pertinent information.Results: A total of 164 patients, with an average age of82.7 ± 10.6 years, were assessed. The mean length of hospitalization was 12.7 ± 10.0 days. Approximately 61% of patients on PPIs lacked a valid indication for their use, whileapproximately one-fifth of patients not on PPIs had a validindication. In both patient groups, the most common indication for PPI usage was prophylaxis in high-risk patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). PPIs did not demonstrate any influence on the length of hospitalization or mortality. On average, each patient on PPIs spent €25.8 per year, contributing to an unnecessary total public funds expenditure of €679.1 in the assessed sample.Conclusion: Considering the advanced age of the individuals, many of them were taking NSAIDs or antiplatelet agents, which is likely the reason for PPI prescription even in the absence of a valid indication. Various efforts have been made to implement measures to reverse this prescribing trend, with some showing effectiveness, notably educational outreach visits.",

Although most cases are sporadic, outbreaks of food origin have been reported. The spectrum of clinical manifestations is diverse, particularly bacteriemia, sepsis, and central nervous system (CNS) infection. It mainly affects elderly patients with important comorbidities or immunosuppression states, and pregnant women. Mortality can reach 30%.Material and Methods: We selected the specimens positive for strains ofListeriaspp. using the laboratory informatic system database of our hospital center from 2013-2020. The patients’ corresponding processes were reviewed for demographic variables and clinical data as predisposing conditions, type of infection and outcome.Results: Twenty-five cases ofListeriainfection were identified, with a mean age of 66.6 years. Most individuals (92%) had some risk factor or predisposing condition, with the most frequent being age > 65 years (64%), followed by the use of proton pump inhibitors, diabetes, alcoholism, neoplasia, and immunosuppressive therapy. Nineteen cases of bacteriemia and 9 cases of CNS infection were observed, and focal forms such as endocarditis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and infected muscle hematoma were observed. Overall mortality was 16%. No patient with CNS infection has died. Only in one case was there a relationship with a possible food outbreak.Conclusion: In our series, we found data similar to those in the literature, but we highlight the high percentage of patients with multiple predisposing conditions, less common focal forms, and the absence of mortality in patients with CNS infection. The analysis of our data allowed us to understand the importance of clarifying the source of infection, which is why we advise the use of a questionnaire regarding the consumption of suspicious food or an outbreak of food origin.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: Hyperkalemia (HK) is characterized by elevated serum potassium levels and is common in patientswith chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. Severe hyperkalemia increases the risk of cardiac disturbances and mortality. Real-world studies and international expert groups highlight the urgent need to optimize hyperkalemia management however, consensus in this area is lacking, especially concerning new drugs. We aim to establish a consensus among healthcare professionals in Portugal regarding the effective management of HK in emergency settings. Additionally, we aim to provide recommendations for the adoption of best practices in emergency care.Methods: This qualitative study was based on Delphiconsensus. A panel of experts collaboratively identified anddiscussed five main topics related to HK management anddefined 25 treatment statements. An online questionnaire was distributed to doctors who frequently handle emergencies between July and August 2023. A consensus was defined when at least 65% of respondents indicated agreement or strong agreement with a statement. The initial round produced high agreement levels, obviating the need for additional survey rounds.Results: A total of 63 specialist doctors participated in the online questionnaire. There was a very high consensus,with over 90% of participants either agreeing or stronglyagreeing with 19 of the 25 statements. These establish thatHK is a critical concern for patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly those with a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), elderly population and patients on medications such as inhibitor renin-angiotensin–aldosterone system (iRAAS), angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs), mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRAs), or potassium-sparing diuretics. They also agree that HK is associated with higher mortality risk, which increases in individuals with underlying conditions or prolonged HK. Statements regarding potassium management involving sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC), patiromer, scavengers in patients on iRAAS, and related to insulin treatment had the lowest consensus levels.Conclusion: A robust consensus among Portuguesehealthcare professionals regarding effective HK management in emergency settings was achieved. Experts collaboratively formulated recommendations covering key aspects of the management of HK in emergency settings. Implementing these recommendations will enhance the delivery of harmonized evidence-based medical care and the improvement of clinical outcomes.",

The prevalence has been increasing in recent years, currently affecting around 25% of the world's population. The hallmark of its pathophysiology lies in insulin resistance and the accumulation of fat inside hepatocytes. Several clinical scores allow cost-effective screening, such as FIB-4 and NFS. Although it is considered the gold standard, liver biopsy can often be avoided by using hepatic elastography. Numerous drugs used in diabetes have therapeutic potential in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, with the most studied class being GLP-1 receptor agonists. The bidirectional pathophysiological association between metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and diabetes will enable the development of this field and the emergence of new therapies",

In this paper a stress estimation algorithm is proposed based on the classification of negative valence emotions in speech recordings.Methods:An end-to-end machine learning pipeline is proposed. Two distinct decision models are considered, VGG-16 and SqueezeNet, while sharing a common constant Q power spectrogram input for acoustic representation. The system is trained and evaluated using the RAVDESS and TESS emotional speech datasets.Results:The system was evaluated for individual emotionclassification (multiclass problem) and also for negative andneutral or positive emotion classification (binary problem). The results achieved are comparable to previously reported systems, with the SqueezeNet model offering a significantly smaller footprint, enabling versatile applications. Further exploration of the model's parameter space holds promise for enhanced performance.Conclusion:The proposed system can constitute a feasibleapproach for the estimation of a low-cost non-invasive biomarker for negative emotions. This allows to raise alerts and develop mitigating actions to the burden of negative emotions, being an additional management tool for healthcare services that allows to maintain quality and maximize availability.",

Several aspects contribute to this difficulty. Chronic and acute complications of diabetes represent loss in quality of life and have a significant impact on resource consumption and global health costs.Technological developments have contributed considerably to the paradigm shift in the reality of those who work in diabetes and those who live with the disease. The incorporation of digital technology and artificial intelligence in diabetes adds value and has already been implemented in clinical practice. This alliance leads to the existence of professionals who are more aware of the health status of people with diabetes, who become much more capable themselves and self-sufficient to manage their own condition.",

One of the most controversial and potentially impactful, is artificial intelligence use in medical imaging. While most commercial and academic attention has focused on higher cost imaging modalities such as magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), ultrasound has also become the target of AI application developers. Ultrasound presents additional barriers to AI application development and execution, not seen in axial imaging such as MRI and CT. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), with its lack of standardization and plethora of inexperienced users, poses the greatest imaging challenge to AI. However, POCUS is also the key to widespread access to diagnostic and interventional ultrasound at the patient’s bedside throughout the world. This article discusses AI, it utilization in POCUS, current challenges, risks, limitations, needs and future possibilities.",

This transformation is triggered by accessibility constraints to healthcare services, increased expectations from patients and sing financial burdens. Rather than being seen as unsolvable obstacles, these challenges can be perceived as powerful stimuli, encouraging the search for innovative and creative solutions, especially in a context where new digital technologies applicable to healthcare are emerging. In the context of this article, which shares a transformative visionof healthcare provision, we describe a pilot program developed for the Heart Failure ambulatory of the Internal Medicine Department at the Braga Local Health Unit (ULS-Braga). This proposal encompasses not only treatment, but also proactive health promotion, based on an approach that incorporates cutting-edge digital technology. The overall aim is to significantly expand the scope of outpatient services and provide innovative home care, bringing it closer to the specific needs of (healthy and sick) individuals.",

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed cases of diabetes and pre-diabetes among patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward, thereby assessing the relevance of routinely conducting glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) determinations for all admitted patients.Material and Methods:In this descriptive observationalcross-sectional study, patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward over a 15-week period were analyzed. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: a prior diagnosis of diabetes, the presence of pathologies or conditions that could interfere with HbA1c measurements, or if screening would not be beneficial due to clinical or ethical considerations. After identifying eligible patients, HbA1c levels were determined, and patients were categorized as “Without Diabetes”, “Pre-Diabetes” or “Diabetes”, with corresponding prevalence rates calculated.Results:Out of 518 hospitalized patients, 207 (39.96%) met the eligibility criteria. Among them, 88 (42.51%) patients had pre-diabetes, while newly diagnosed diabetes casesaccounted for 10.15% (n = 21) of the eligible population.Conclusion:Given the rate of initial diabetes diagnoses,routine screening upon admission appears relevant andought to be considered according to local context.",

Regular coagulation tests correlate poorly with plasma concentrations of direct oral anticoagulants, so specialized anti-Xa and anti-IIa assays are necessary.Methods:In this study, we analyzed all the Emergency Department electronic medical records corresponding to patients that had direct oral anticoagulants quantification assays performed during a six-month period.Results:Of the 88 admissions evaluated, the main indications for anticoagulation were atrial fibrillation or flutter and previous thrombotic events. Direct oral anticoagulants quantification was performed mainly due to hemorrhagic events and need for urgent invasive technical procedures. At admission, most patients had direct oral anticoagulants concentrations > 50 ng/mL and more than half had their anticoagulation suspended at discharge (pending further evaluation in an outpatient setting). 26% did prothrombin complex and 5% did Idarucizumab, due to clinical severity. None of the patients did Andexanet alfa due to its unavailability. Regarding readmissions within 6 months, only 5 patients were readmitted, with recurrent bleeding or anemia and no thromboembolic events were registered.Conclusion:Direct oral anticoagulants quantification minimized unnecessary complications associated with urgent surgical and invasive technical procedures. Creating Emergency Department protocols, accessible to all specialties, regarding direct oral anticoagulants quantification and its main indications, should be a priority in anticoagulation management, guiding clinical decisions and reducing duration of hospital stay, comorbidities and mortality.",

No other professionals, healthcare settings, or testing technologies are included, despite innovations toward more patient-centric care.Methods:We performed a focused review of literaturepublished between 2011 and 2021 regarding reflex (in which confirmation of antibody-positive test is done on the initial serum specimen) or single-step testing, HCV core antigen (cAg), and point-of-care (POC) HCV NAAT.Results:We incorporated a total of 44 relevant papers,mostly from Spain and the United States of America.Discussion:Reflex testing workflows have consistentlybeen shown to increase completion of confirmatory testing,screening program cost-effectiveness, patient linkageto care, and treatment initiation. HCV cAg determinationhas also been established as an acceptable alternative toNAAT for confirmatory testing, with lower cost and lowerturnaround time (70% and 85% respectively). Lastly, POCHCV NAAT enables decentralized screening in communitysettings, with minimal infrastructure and technical expertiserequired. Although concerns remain regarding the cost ofPOC NAAT solutions, their availability is crucial in empowering facilities caring for at-risk populations to perform timely confirmatory testing and increase patient linkage to care and treatment.Conclusion:There is a strong body of evidence to supportreflex testing as the standard of care for HCV screeningin all healthcare settings. HCV cAg or POC HCV NAATconfirmatory testing should also be supported where appropriate, in alternative to strictly central laboratory-based HCV NAAT.",

During a one-month period, we consulted all electronic medical records of internal medicine appointments to assess which patients presented inclusion and exclusion criteria of the COMPASS trial.Results:Of 228 patients, 40 (17.5%) met inclusion criteriafor COMPASS trial. Twelve (30.0%) had coronary artery disease, 21 (52.5%) had peripheral artery disease, and 6 (1.5%) had both. One patient was already on the COMPASS trial strategy. Of those who met inclusion criteria, 70.0% (n = 28) presented at least one exclusion criteria. The most frequent was the use of oral anticoagulation (mostly due to atrial fibrillation), followed by the users of non- acetylsalicylic acid antiplatelet therapy.Conclusion:The number of internal medicine patients who are eligible to benefit from the COMPASS strategy is relevant. Internal medicine physicians must be aware of inclusion and exclusion criteria of this new prevention strategy to promptly apply it in clinical practice.",

From thephenotypic analyses of the mutation carriers, some common features were found: male, over 50 years old, cytopenias, fever and constitutional symptoms, and all organs and systems with variable manifestations and proportions may be involved. The inflammatory and multi-systemic nature of this disease leads to a diagnostic and treatment challenge, adding to the already existing high morbimortality. Presently, the treatments with greater efficiency are corticosteroid therapy, azacytidine, JAK-1/2 inhibitors and interleukin-6 inhibitors. There are also benefits in autologous stem cell transplants.Given its recent identification and low number of diagnosedpatients, most available studies have limitations related to the methodology and short duration of follow-up, prevailing the need for prospective clinical trials in order todefine the best therapeutic strategies and to improve thesepatients’ prognosis.",

A comparative analysis of outcomes of anticoagulant therapy was performed between direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs).Results:A total of 28 patients (22 male patients; medianage 75 years) were included in the study, of which 19 werepreviously on anticoagulation therapy. Only eight (re)started anticoagulation after discharge. There were 19 deaths, of which 17 were in the group without post-discharge anticoagulation; of those, five occurred in the first month after ICH.Conclusion:Most patients did not (re)initiate anticoagulation after ICH, despite being a high-risk group for new cerebrovascular events, which makes the discussion on this topic even more relevant.

            "resumo": "AbstractThe leading cause of death and disability worldwide aredue to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), entailing a heavy economic impact, in Portugal corresponding to 1% of the gross domestic product. The development and progression of ASCVD are closely related to hypercholesterolaemia, with high LDL-C levels being its most important and easily modifiable risk factor. Reducing LDL-C has been shown to decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events and European recommendations advocate LDL-C target values according to the patient's cardiovascular risk. The risk of hypercholesterolaemia is cumulative, making it relevant to reduce LDL-C as early as possible.Despite the efficacy and safety demonstrated by severalexisting lipid-lowering therapies, in the real world most patients do not achieve the recommended lipid values. Several limitations to adequate lipid control have been pointed out, namely the low adherence of patients to treatment.Inclisiran is the first drug to inhibit PCSK9 synthesis throughRNA small interference mechanism. With a subcutaneousadministration every six months after initial and 3-month dose, it allows a LDL-C reduction higher than 50%, with a good safety profile. The advantage of its long duration of action will potentially overcome the low compliance of patients to treatment and increase the effectiveness in reducing LDL-C, which may translate into a reduction in morbidity and mortality from ASCVD and its high economic impact.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction:Rapid diagnostic testing for pneumonia has the presume potential to guide clinical decisions in reducing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. These benefits shouldbe dependent upon the accuracy of these test. In order to evaluate the diagnostic yield and accuracy of the BioFire® FilmArray® pneumonia panel (BFFA) for pathogens identification in lower respiratory tract specimens, we conduct this retrospective study in a intensive care unit (ICU).Methods:In this study were included all patients (n = 104) admitted in our ICU with pneumonia who underwent BFFA test, between December 2019 and March 2021. Lower respiratory tract samples were collected and analysed simultaneously with BFPP and microbiological culture, as part of standard-of-care testing. The BFFA panel includes for 18 bacteria and 8 virus, that commonly cause pneumonia as well 7 antibiotic resistance genes, identified from tracheal aspirate or bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) specimens.Results:This study included 104 patients, with an average age of 62 years. The BFFA was positive in 111/125 (88%) samples. The most common bacteria detected were Staphylococcus aureus (19%), Klebsiella pneumonia (14%) and Haemophilus influenza (10%).Discussion:There was strong concordance between BFFA and culture for detection of bacteria. In fact, most bacteria (76/106 [72%]) detected by BFFA were also identified in culture. In other hand, it is relevant that only one negative BFPP had an isolated agent in the cultural exam.Conclusion:Real-time specimen analysis with BFFA has the potential to identify bacterial and viral pathogens and theirs resistance markers, faster than traditional culture-basedmethods.In fact, the BFFA is a rapid and accurate method for detection of pathogens from lower respiratory tract infections with a 72% sensitivity and 100% specificity, in our studied population.",

Data on delirium home-based palliative care are scarce. The aim of this work is tocharacterize the population followed by a palliative care team,both in-hospital and at home, to assess the prevalence of delirium, the therapeutic strategy, its resolution, and the factorsassociated with the higher or lower prevalence of delirium.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was carried out,including all patients followed in the hospital and at home by apalliative care team in Portugal during the year of 2019.Results:A total of 496 patients were included, of whom308 (62.1%) had in-hospital follow-ups. Delirium was identified in 112 (22.6%) of all patients and the first line drug usedwas haloperidol (51.8%). A total of 283 (57.1%) patients died,of whom 81 (28.6%) developed delirium. The occurrence ofdeath was significantly higher in those who developed delirium(72.3%, p <0.001).

            "resumo": "AbstractHerpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus. It is a high-incidence disease, associated with great morbidity, which might create or worsen a patient’s frailty condition, thus reinforcing the importance of vaccination. Among the risk factors for HZ infection and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), its major complication, are age, immunosuppression and the presence ofchronic conditions. Vaccination is an efficacious strategy to prevent HZ and PHN. In Portugal, there are two available HZ vaccines: the live attenuated vaccine and the recombinant vaccine, which demonstrated a high efficacy against HZ and its complications, particularly in the populations with higher risk, immunosuppressed and with immunosenescence for whom live attenuated vaccine is contraindicated. Notwithstanding, the HZ vaccine is not included in the National Vaccination Program and there are not specific national recommendations for immunization. Hence, the Portuguese Society of Internal Medicine and the Portuguese Association of General and Family Medicine elaborated a consensus report establishing guidelines for HZ vaccination.Vaccination against HZ is recommended for all adults aged 50 years and over, as well as for adults aged between 18 and 49 years at high risk for HZ, namely patients withcomorbidities or immunosuppression. Immunocompetentadults should be preferentially immunized with the recombinant vaccine, although they might receive the live attenuated vaccine in punctual situations; immunocompromised adults should only be immunized with the recombinant vaccine. The vaccination of individuals with a previous HZ episode is recommended, and individuals with prior immunization with the live attenuated vaccine should receive the recombinant vaccine. Promoting patient’s literacy when prescribing HZ vaccine is highly relevant, and the physician should have an active role in raising awareness about the importance of shingles vaccination.",

Among them, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), associated with deregulation of alternative complement pathway (genetic/acquired), represents a diagnostic challenge. Characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy, acute renal failure is one of its main features. Etiological/ precipitant detection (TMA triggers) is essential, even though about 30% of cases remain idiopathic. There is not a direct diagnostic test, which makes this an exclusion final diagnosis (after primary and secondary causes are ruled-out). Further testingfor genetic variations is important for prognostic purposes.We describe the case of a 40 years old woman, whosefinal diagnostic was an atypical HUS associated with SARS--CoV-2 infection. This case stands out by its rarity.We underline the importance of prompt initial diagnosis and timely target treatment beginning: Eculizumab, the only one available in Portugal at the moment. Plasmapheresis and/orrenal replacement therapy must be considered case by case.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction:Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Nonetheless, the underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood.Certain factors have shown association with increased risk,but there is still data lacking. The main objective of this studywas to identify factors associated with AKI in CAP.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study in patientswith confirmed CAP, admitted to an Internal Medicine department within a period of 1 year, presenting with or without AKI onadmission. We performed comparative statistics between non-AKI and AKI patients, univariate and multivariable logistic regression with odds ratio (OR) calculation, and survival analysis.Results:This study included 578 patients, of which 52.4%were male, had a mean age of 81.70±11.54 years, and41.3% had AKI. The mean age was higher in the AKI group (p<0.001), with no differences for gender. In the univariate analysis, several comorbidities, drugs, diastolic blood pressure andsome gasometric parameters showed association with AKI.The multivariable analysis selected seven variables as independent associated factors: age (OR 1.027), hyperuricemia(OR 1.990), chronic kidney disease (OR 3.138), diuretic (OR1.555), statin (OR 1.805), diastolic blood pressure (OR 0.978)and serum lactate (OR 1.350), enabling the development of anAKI probabilistic model with a specificity of 81.1%.Conclusion:This study confirmed previous findings andidentified new factors associated with AKI, namely serum lactate. The multivariable model represents a starting point forthe creation of true predictive indexes of AKI in CAP with clinical applicability and impact on the therapeutic approach andprognosis.",

The present study aims to analyse outcome predictors in elderly patients admitted to the internal medicine (IM) service.Methods:Observational, retrospective, longitudinal study Medical records of patients 65 or more years old admitted to the IM service of Hospital Garcia de Orta (HGO), Portugal, in the year 2019 were analysed.Results:In 2019 the HGO’s IM service admitted 2841patients: 532 (18.7%) were less than 65 years old and 2309(81.3%) were 65 years old or older. In the statistical analyses2133 patients were included, with a mean age of 80.0 ± 7.8years. Female gender represented 54.7% of the sample size.Mean number of comorbidities per patient was 6.1 ± 2.8, and 54.8% were considered frail. Frail patients were at higher risk of death in hospital (RR = 3.1) and after discharge (RR = 2), even after adjustment for confounders.Conclusion:The population admitted to IM services ismainly elderly with variable degrees of multimorbidity and frailty. frailty seems to be a major predictor of readmission and death in this population. Given the heterogenicity of this age group, multidimensional evaluations and individualized care plans are mandatory. It is urgent that Portuguese IM services adapt to the care of elderly patients, with a strong investment in interdisciplinary care focused on quality of life. Education in geriatric medicine should be a priority to IM teams.",

It is necessary to know what they think and consider to be their information and training needs.The Núcleo de Estudos de Bioética of the SPMI carried out an opinion survey among Portuguese internists on the clarity of the terms used in the law, their consistency with the rest of the legal and ethical system of the profession and on the training needs in this area.About 42% of the respondents showed unavailability to get involved in this new medical act. The clinical conditionssusceptible to access to the procedure are not of clear meaning for more than 70% of the respondents, according to the terms defined in the law: “definitive injury of extreme gravity”, “serious or incurable injury” and “suffering of great intensity”. Less than 16% consider that Portugal offers good end-of-life care and that the request for death provoked at one's own request does not constitute a priority criterion for access to Palliative Care.The present study carried out with Portuguese internistsidentifies doubts, difficulties and reveals the opinions of respondents, often with opposing views. The collected data help to understand the problem and give clues for future investigations and developments.",

A practical bedside assessment of venous congestion is often challenging due to the limitations of traditional methods.Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) provides a realtime picture of the patients' anatomy and physiology (including analysis of dynamic flows), allowing a diagnosis and monitoring of venous congestion with a higher sensitivity than standard physical examination.In this brief summary, the authors summarize the physiology of venous congestion and the most recent tools for congestion assessment by POCUS.",

It is estimated that malnutrition affects one in three elderly people at home and one in three patients in elderly care institutions. Malnutrition is reversible as long as the patient has access to timely nutritional screening that identifies their nutritional risk and as long as an individualized nutritional intervention is instituted. Disease associated malnutrition continues to be perceived as a secondary problem in primary health care, so the implementation of nutritional risk screening, as a routine parameter, is the first step in improving access to nutritional care in the community. In this article, the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool is proposed for routine nutritional screening in primary care.",

In addition, several cardiovascular risk factors, like arterial hypertension, were identified as risk factors for greater disease severity and mortality in these patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of hypertension in patients with COVID-19 and its association with complications, comorbidities and mortality.Methods:Retrospective study of the patients with COVID-19 admitted to Internal Medicine ward between March 2020and February 2021. Data was collected from the digital clinical file. Logistic regression was applied to clarify the effect of independent variables on mortality.Results:The sample included 1291 patients with COVID-19, a median age of 73 years (IQR: 22) and male gender predominance (n = 701, 54.3%). There were 65.5% (n = 845) of patients with hypertension, 54.9% (n = 709) dyslipidemia and about a third had diabetes mellitus and obesity (31 and 38%, respectively). Comparatively to the non-hypertensive patients, hypertensive group presented with higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, obesity and dyslipidemia (p <0.001)) and lower functionality and more comorbidities (as calculated by AVDezIS and Charlson modified scores, p<0.001). There was also higher proportion of severe COVID-19 disease (p = 0.003), greater number of patients admitted to intensive care units (p <0.001) and higher in-hospital mortality (p <0.001). Hypertension was not a mortality predictive factor in these patients.Conclusion:In this study, patients with hypertension presented with higher severity of COVID-19 disease, higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, complications during hospitalization and in-hospital mortality, however, its presence was not a mortality predictive factor.",

Depending on age, comorbidities, co-ingestion of other medications and the magnitude of toxic ingestion, clinical presentation can range from asymptomatic to shock. High dose insulin seems to be an effective adjunctive therapy, despite the lack of randomized studies. We report a series of cases of calcium channel blockers voluntary intoxication with clinical improvement after treatment with high dose insulin. Patients were young and without major comorbidities. Amlodipine was the drug used and, in two cases, there was co-ingestion of other drugs. At admission, despite volume replacement, all patients had persistent hypotension requiring vasopressor support. High doseinsulin perfusion was started early, with a mean infusion of0.67 U/kg/h, which allowed a sustained reduction in vasopressor dose. Hypokalemia and hypoglycemia were frequent, but without severity. In conclusion, it is essential that health professionals know how to recognize and manage these clinical situations given its high risk of mortality. High dose insulin seems to be a viable and safe therapy in these patients as long as intensive monitoring is guaranteed.",

            "resumo": "AbstractCrusted scabies or Norwegian scabies is a severe and highly contagious clinical variant of infestation by Sarcoptes scabiei, which can evolve exuberantly, coursing with diffuseerythroderma, which makes etiological diagnosis difficult, especially by non-dermatologists. Thus, the authors present a case report of erythroderma in a 65-year-old woman, whodeveloped intense pruritus associated with erythroderma for about 2 weeks, with an associated fever peak. She had a previous clinical history of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with long-term use of immunosuppressants and systemic corticosteroids. Evaluated by dermatologists who, through direct examination by skin scraping and skin biopsy, confirmed the diagnosis of crusted scabies. Based on this case report, the importance of differential diagnoses of erythroderma is highlighted, especially crusted scabies, a rare dermatosis that most often affects immunocompromised, frail, institutionalized patients or patients with precarious social conditions.",

Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapies to help us change this trajectory.Tirzepatide, the first of a new pharmacological classnamed co-agonists or dual agonists of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), has demonstrated in clinical trials published in the last two years, to significantly reduce blood glucose, improve insulin resistance and reduce body weight, with additional benefits on hypertension and lipid profile. Additional data on its impact on cardiovascular endpoints are eagerly awaited.In this article it is presented a review of this new drug andthe new perspectives that its appearance will open, in the future of the treatment of diabetes and obesity",

This often complica its clinical diagnosis, especially in early stages, hampers its study and understanding and prevents appropriate treatment to be given in due time, in numerous situations. Furthermore, it hinders clinical research for a better understanding of the syndrome and its treatment, in different homogeneous groups of patients with RF. Clinical practice demonstrates that we have an incomplete knowledge of RF, its diagnostic approach, management and treatment. RF directly impacts patient’s quality of life and prognosis. It should be considered a nosologic entity, with unique clinical, physiopathological and dynamic characteristics, that demands a dedicated investigation aiming to be better understood and treated with the goal of changing its course and improve clinical outcomes.",

Supplementary oxygen therapy plays an important role on that. In the last years, the use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) in palliative care has been developed. We present three cases of patients accompanied by the Palliative Care Team who used HFNC for dyspnoea control and the team’s effort for organizing domiciliary use of it. All patients showed a better quality of life, in what concerns dyspnoea, and the use of opioid therapy was reduced. The presence of the Palliative Care Team was essential for the patient, family and domiciliary care team’s support. HFNC seems to be a possible secure and effective resource in the management of respiratory symptoms in the palliative patient, along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies.",

In February 2021, the first cases of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis at uncommon sites (cerebral venous sinus and splanchnic venous thrombosis) induced by the vaccines were described. The incidence is still unknown, but early studies in the USA suggest an incidence of 1 in 533 333/vaccinated individuals, and this is probably underestimated. Although uncommon, it is a serious adverse effect with a high mortality rate, estimated at 20%. This case report highlights the need for a high level of suspicion, which may change the prognosis of some of these patients.",

On day 7 of disease, clinical worsening, so a computed tomography scan was performed revealing findings compatible with renal, splenic and hepatic hypoperfusion. Echocardiogram showed systolic dysfunction due to global hypocontractility (LVEF 25%-30%). MIS-A was admitted, with cutaneous, gastrointestinal and cardiac involvement. She was treated with human immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone and diuretics, with progressive clinical improvement and recovery of cardiac function.Contrary to the more common severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in which pulmonary involvement prevails, in this syndrome the respiratory involvement is often mild, making it a diagnostic challenge.",

Although the lungs are the primary site of involvement, the disease can affect virtually any organ, leading to a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Haematological abnormalities are uncommon, and most frequently include lymphopenia and anaemia. Thrombocytopenia, however, is rare, and three distinct pathophysiological mechanisms have been described: immune platelet destruction, splenomegaly with hypersplenism, and bone marrow infiltration. We report a case of sarcoidosis presenting with pulmonary and cutaneous involvement, and severe acute thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow aspirate was consistent with an immune process, assumed as the primary cause for the cytopenia, but bone marrow biopsy also showed multiple noncaseating granulomas, and a CT scan revealed massive splenomegaly. There are no guidelines for the management of thrombocytopenia in sarcoidosis. In our patient, treatment with intravenous immune globulin and corticosteroids restored normal platelet count.",

However, there is still uncertainty about its diagnostic accuracy and reliability, with studies warranting larger cohorts. In one of the largest and most heterogeneous cohorts considered to date, the aim was to vali[1]date and explore the applicability of the CAM-ICU (European Portuguese) as a delirium screening and diagnostic tool in the ED setting of a main hospital referral centre.Methods:Data were randomly and prospectively recorded in a convenience sample of patients with 18 years or older admitted to the ED of Hospital de Braga (Braga, Portugal). Delirium status was primarily assessed using the CAM- -ICU. For the validation aspect, the reference standard was a psychiatric evaluation, conducted within 3 hours of the CAM- -ICU by a psychiatrist blind to the finding, using the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, without external interference on the regular proceedings in the ED on the timing, number and operationalization of psychiatric evaluations in the setting.Results:After exclusion/inclusion criteria, of the 592 patients evaluated, 19.8% were diagnosed with delirium using the CAM-ICU. The reference standard was applied to 81 patients. The CAM-ICU presented a sensitivity of 95.2% (95% CI= 74.1 to 99.8) and specificity of 88.3% (95% CI= 76.8 to 94.8). CAM-ICU showed an accuracy of 90.1% with the reference standard.Conclusion:The CAM-ICU (Portuguese version) is practical, valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of delirium in the real setting of an ED showing sensibility, specificity and accuracy for delirium diagnosis.",

We report the case of an 80-year-old man admitted for multifocal stroke, altered coagulation tests, and worsening renal function. After extensive investigation, the diagnosis of multisystem thrombosis in the context of chronic DIC was assumed. A lymph node biopsy documented lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. Therapeutic enoxaparin was started but the patient rapidly deteriorated and died. Thrombotic microangiopathies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of stroke, especially if multifocal and associated with ischemic manifestations in other organs. Chronic DIC can be secondary to mucin-producing solid adenocarcinomas and has been increasingly reported in stage IV lung cancer. The overall prognosis is poor, and anticoagulation is insufficient in the absence of treatment of the underlying disease.",

With the support of the GulbenkianFoundation and the work of a large luso-brazilian team, fourvolumes have now been recovered and published, allowingthe dissemination of his remarkable work. It follows the movement described at the same time by Michel Foucault in hisseminal work, “Naissance de la Clinique” as the emergence of Modern Medicine. Presented and disseminated at Conferences and Symposia in the Literature and History circles,it is only right that this work should be made known to thewider medical community.

The age at diagnosis ranged between 6 and 35 years. Three patients have histological diagnoses and 2 enzymatic diagnoses. All were medicated with ERT (4 imiglucerase, 1 velaglucerase), and 3 were previously medicated with alglucerase. The age at onset of ERT ranged between 26 and 52 years-old. Prior to ERT, 80% had thrombocytopenia, 100% anaemia, 40% splenomegaly (although the remaining 60% were previously splenectomised), 100% hepatomegaly and 80% bone pain. After 6 months of treatment, there was a reduction in the volume of the spleen and liver, improvement of anaemia and thrombocytopenia and improved bone pain.

Data were collected from the hospital system records and registered in a database. We analyzed demographic, clinical and imaging characteristics and data from the etiological investigation and functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale).Results:Of the 27 patients included, 21 (78%) were women and the mean age was 43.5 years. The most frequent presentation was headache (96.3%). An oral contraceptive was the most common risk factor identified (44.4%). The initial examination was made by head computed tomography (CT) scan in 23 (85.2%) patients, out of the 20 evocative characteristics of CVT. Diagnosis was confirmed by CT venography or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). More than 50% of patients had involvement of more than one venous structure. A heparin-based treatment was administered to all patients and the clinical status for discharge was favourable in 25 cases.Conclusion:CVT mainly affected young women, with oral contraception being a major risk factor. The clinical picture tended to be nonspecific, with headache as the most frequent manifestation. In case of clinical suspicion, a negative head CT does not exclude the diagnosis and the investigation should be continued with MR and MRA.

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important cause of liver disease, presenting several clinical manifestations.The discovery of direct acting antivirals has revolutionized the treatment of this infection, these new antivirals allowed the eradication of the virus in more than 95% of the cases. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic changed the normal functioning of health services, and this could compromise this goal.Methods:Retrospective analysis of patients treated and followed in a district hospital between January 1, 2015, andDecember 31, 2020.Results:We treated 267 patients, 77.9% men, the averageage being 50 years old. History of intravenous drug use was de risk factor in 55%. Genotype 1 was the most common (64%), 27% had liver cirrhosis and 32% had been submitted to other treatments. The average of the waiting time for treatment was 3.19 months, before the pandemic it was 3.11 months and in 2020 it was 4.15 months, this difference is statistically significant (p = 0.017). The number of patients treated over the years has been decreasing. The most used treatment was ledispasvir/ sofosbuvir. The sustained virological response was 99%. Patients were discharged in 70% of the cases.Discussion:This retrospective study is the first, at nationallevel, to evaluate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the treatment of HCV infection. It showed an increase in the waiting time for treatment in the year 2020. The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on this pathology is still unclear.Conclusion:The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to an increasein the waiting time for treatment and a decrease in the number of patients with HCV infection treated, making it difficult to eradicate the virus",

In the EMO Study (Neves, 2012) authors found that the use of oxygen in Portuguese Internal Medicine wards did not follow the legis artis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of creating and implementing an oxygen therapy prescription protocol by target saturation range in an Internal Medicine Service.Methods: A prospective study was carried out in two consecutive years, focusing on a representative sample of hospitalized patients, evaluating demographic variables, type of prescription, identification of the risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, prescription compliance and administration failures.Results: A total of 781 patients were included in the study, 583 (74.6%) had oxygen prescribed, of which 573 (98.3%) by target saturation range.Two hundred thirty five (30.1%) patients with risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure were identified, which increased significantly in the last year of the study (26.7%vs33.3%,p= 0.043). At the time of evaluation, 390 (77.4%) of the patients with a target saturation range prescription were on target. There was a significant increase in prescriptions for target range saturation (72.7% vs 99.6% in 2017 vs 97% in 2018, p = 0.017) and in the identification of patients at risk for hypercapnic respiratory failure (12.3% vs 26.7% in 2017 vs 33.3% in 2018, p = 0.002).Conclusion: The creation of the prescription protocol and the training of the medical and nursing teams allowed for improved patient care, as can be seen by a significant improvement in the prescription by target range and in the identification of patients at risk for type 2 respiratory failure.",

It can be caused by a broad spectrum of diseases with very different prognostic outcomes. Constant re-evaluation of clinical data is essential considering the dynamic changes in disease patterns. We aim to understand which clinical approach is most commonly used and recognize our local epidemiology in order to improve the diagnostic approach to these patients.Methods:We performed a retrospective study in an internal medicine department of a public tertiary hospital. Clinical records of all patients admitted during 2016 and 2017 were onsulted; data from patients that fulfilled FUO criteria were collected.Results:A total of 55 FUO patients were identified (0.6% of all admissions). Infections were the most frequent cause (n = 23; 41.8%) followed by non-infectious inflammatory diseases (n = 12; 21.8%), malignancies (n = 8; 14.5%) and miscellaneous group (n = 3; 5.5%). However, in 9 cases (16.4%) the etiology remained unknown. The most common disease causing FUO was Q fever, followed by infective bacterial endocarditis and abscesses in different locations. Microbiological study of urine and blood was performed in all patients, while serological tests showed wider variability. The use of 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) in 11 (20.0%) cases stands out.Conclusion:FUO etiologies in our cohort were comparable to other published studies despite the smaller sample. Infections were the most frequent cause identified. Though a significant number of cases remained unknown, it carried a good prognosis.",

The improving survival in malignant and non-malignant diseases results in an ageing population who live with advanced chronic diseases that commonly present to acute care settings. With our improved ability to relief symptoms and treat intercurrent complications, imaging can be an important aspect of modern palliative care. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is ultrasound used at the bedside to answer directed clinical questions and guide clinical care. The goals of our review are to provide greater understanding about utility and appropriateness of the use of POCUS in palliative care. The use of POCUS in the clinical setting has increased substantially in recent years, and its characteristics make it an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic adjunct in palliative care, namely in home-based care.",

On the day of admission and on the fifth day of follow-up, an ultrasound evaluation of the thickness of the biceps brachii and quadriceps femoris was performed. During the five-day period we also analyzed the energy and protein support that was provided to the patients.Results: Thirty five patients were enrolled in this study with a mean age of 64±15, mostly male gender (62.9%). There was a loss of 1.77 mm in the thickness of the biceps brachii and 2.19 mm in the quadriceps femoris. We observed that the patients received an estimated daily nutritional support that corresponds to 20.0% of their energy and 24.9% of their protein needs.Conclusion: It is feasible to objectively and non-invasively evaluate the muscle mass in critically ill patients and there was a significant decrease in muscle mass in the first days after admission.

Over the COVID-19 pandemics there was a shift in policies focusing on infection prevention and control programs.Methods: We postulate that such shift may have an indirect effect in the occurrence of nosocomial infections. We performed a retrospective study aiming to compare the differences in nosocomial infection prevalence between a COVID19 period and a non-COVID-19 period, in a free-COVID-19 Internal Medicine ward from a central hospital in Lisbon. We included 393 patients, 192 patients being from the non-COVID-19 period and 201 patients from the COVID-19 period.Results: We found a statistically significant reduction in the occurrence of nosocomial infections in the COVID-19 period from 16.1% (n = 31) to 5.5% (n = 11) (p = 0.001; OR 0.301; 95% CI: 0.146-0.617).

Patients with higher ratio presented severer neurological deficits at admission, higher mortality, and dependency on discharge (p < 0.01). A logistic regression was performed to ascertain the predictive capacity of NLR (≥3) and A2DS2 (≥6) on the likelihood of developing PSP (p < 0.005). The model explained 17.1% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in pneumonia diagnoses, correctly classifying 77.0% of patients with 96.3% specificity. Patients with A2DS2 ≥6 were likelier to develop pneumonia (OR 8.36, p < 0.01). Moreover, patients with NLR ≥3 had higher odds of developing pneumonia (OR 2.35, p < 0.01).Conclusion: NLR appears to be related to severity in AIS, possibly as surrogate of neuroimmune mediation. Advances in the understanding of the immunobiological effects of ischemia in the brain may lead to future therapeutic developments. Presently, as a relatively inexpensive biomarker, there may be a potential role for NLR in improving PSP prediction scores.",

Clinically it is manifested by the tetrad: palpable purpura, arthritis/arthralgias, abdominal complaints and kidney injury. Although the pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, infections, medications and neoplasia have been suggested as triggers. Morbidity is related to the progression to chronic kidney disease. PHS is very common in children but rare in adults and the elderly. For this reason, we present two cases of HSP in two patients over 60 years old, with renal and intestinal injury. Because renal involvement and failure is most common in this population (when compared to children), it ismportant to consider this diagnosis in the adult population due to its important morbidity and mortality.",

            "resumo": "AbstractSystemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the extracutaneous proliferation of clonal MC in the bone marrow or other extramedullary sites with or without cutaneous involvement. GastrointestinaI (GI) manifestations, consisting of abdominal pain, diarrhea and malabsorption with various degrees of severity, are frequent in patients with SM and can result from mediator release or direct MC infiltration of the GI tract. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic and recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort associated with defecation or change in bowel habit. The interaction between immune system and neuropeptides and the enhancement of an inflammatory mucosal response with an increase in immune cells is a key feature of IBS. Previous evidence shows that there is an increased number of MC in the intestinal and colonic mucosa of IBS patients. MC are present in the GI and their activation has been associated to some pro-secretory neurotransmitters such as substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide in the proximity of enteric nerves suggesting a bidirectional regulatory pathway with neurocrine control of MC activation. Research concerning the role of enteric MC in both SM and IBS is still scarce as well as their link to neuropeptides. Likewise, more evidence is needed regarding MC and neuropeptides interaction in order to further comprehend the pathophysiology of the GI manifestations of SM and IBS, and the boundaries between these pathologies. In this review we hypothesize that GI symptoms SM and in IBS have similar mechanisms and mediators, with a special focus in the role of mucosal MC and neuropeptides.",

Home hospitalization is considered as a valid alternative to conventional hospitalization, characterized by providing hospitalized level healthcare at home and a personalized approach adapted to the individual reality of each patient in their usual environment. The direct connection between the health professionals, the patient and their caregivers outside the hostile environment of the hospital, and at the same time without losing the safety and quality of care, allows to reinforce the humanization of Medicine, improve the perception of the disease and create unique education and health promotion opportunities tailored to that patient or family. The aging of the population and the increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases are increasing the pressure on the number of hospital beds available. From the perspective of the sustainability of the NHS, home hospitalization reduces the costs and complications inherent to conventional hospitalization and can be a solution to the problem of overcrowding, with clinical advantages for the patient. Despite the national progression, home hospitalization continues to be little known by the population and professionals. This article aims to highlight and publicize the particularities of this quality service.",

Several cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), appear to play a substantial role. Therefore, biologics such as anti-TNF-α agents are rising to control severe or refractory BD´s manifestations.We aimed to describe the biological therapy´s outcomes in BD patients.Methods:A longitudinal, prospective, unicentric cohort study with patients followed in a specialized outpatient clinic. We collected data regarding BD´s manifestations, treatments, and outcomes during follow-up.Results:Our cohort includes 243 patients, of whom 31% were male. During follow-up, 20 patients (8%) were treated with biological drugs. Patients who received biological therapies were younger (p= 0.030), had less frequently genital aphthosis (p= 0.009), and more frequently erythema nodosum (p= 0.009), polyarthritis (p= 0.002), spondyloarthritis (p= 0.024), retinal vasculitis (p= 0.011) and gastrointestinal manifestations (p= 0.024), namely gastroduodenal ulcer (p= 0.035), digestive bleeding from ulcers (p= 0.002), and bowel perforation (p = 0.004). Anti-TNF-α agents were used in all of these patients, most frequently infliximab. Patients started biologicals after classical immunosuppressors failure, and most went into remission (93%). Three patients developed tuberculosis during treatment, regardless of regular screening tests. It was possible to stop biological therapy in five patients, so far, without recurrence, with 33 months of mean follow-up time after suspension.Discussion:Anti-TNF-α agents are highly effective for refractory BD´s manifestations, although they are not innocuous. Little is known about the optimal duration of these therapies, regarding when and how to stop these drugs. This issue is essential not only to avoid relapses but also to reduce therapy side-effects.",

Screening programs and elective surgery may prevent such a life-threatening event. We pretend to evaluate if internal medicine residents would be able to perform quality abdominal ultrasound for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening, and therefore increase our diagnostic accuracy of this life-threatening condition.Material and Methods:Five internal medicine residents without previous experience in ultrasound screened men over 65 years admitted to Internal Medicine wards for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. The patients were evaluated in different times by two internal medicine residents, and a subset of patients was also evaluated by vascular surgery attendant or abdominal computed tomography scan (established as gold standard evaluations). Agreement between both internal medicine resident’s observations and internal medicine residents’ and gold standard evaluations were analyzed.Results:A total of 98 patients were evaluated, with 8 abdominal aortic aneurysms diagnosed, resulting in an 8.2% prevalence. There was good agreement regarding Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm presence and measurement between internal medicine residents’ examinations (κ = 0.918, p < 0.01) and internal medicine residents’/gold standard (κ = 0.950, p < 0.01).Discussion and Conclusion:Abdominal aortic aneurysm prevalence in our study was high. Internal medicine residents were able to accurately diagnose aortic abdominal aneurysm. Point of care opportunistic aortic abdominal aneurysm screening can be performed in Internal Medicine wards, providing an early diagnosis and referral for elective repair surgery.",

However, the proportion of patients that are not on OACs and have indication to be is still high. Our aim was to evaluate the proportion of AF patients receiving anticoagulation therapy and to evaluate the quality of OACs prescribing.Material and Methods:A cross-sectional study was undertaken in the Internal Medicine Department of a hospital from Alentejo (01-04/2019). Patients were included if they were aged ≥18, had previous history of non-valvular AF and presented a CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 (male) or ≥ 3 (female). Both the number of patients that were using OACs and the number of patients that were correctly anticoagulated were extracted. Data analysis was performed using uni- and bivariate statistics (IBM SPSS v.20.0).Results: A total of 203 patients were included, where 51.7% (n = 105) were female with a mean age of 80.2 ± 9.4 years old. Around 40% (n = 82) of those patients were not on OAC. Fifty-seven percent (n = 20) of patients that had previous history of cerebrovascular events were not on OACs. A quarter of the sample (n = 31) were incorrectly anticoagulated. Patients on OACs tended to be younger and with a higher number of concurrent medication (p= 0.001 andp= 0.027, respectively).Conclusion:Data suggest a high proportion of patients eligible for OACs are not receiving treatment. Moreover, among those treated, a quarter was incorrectly anticoagulated. The institution of compulsory continuous professional development or health-system performance indicators should be considered to improve the prescribing pattern.",

Poor compliance was reported in 40% of VD (-) patients. After treatment, there were no statistically difference in variables analysed between the two groups: NYHA class I, NT-proBNP, HF hospitalizations in the previous year, Duke Activity Score Index score and 6-minute Walking Distance. VD (+) group had a statistically significant decrease of NT-proBNP level over time (1740 ± 2761 pg/mL to 851 ± 1436 pg/mL,p= 0.001).

We report a case of a 70-year-old type 2 diabetic woman that presented with gastrointestinal symptoms 1 month after empagliflozin introduction. Elevated hepatic enzymes were found and despite ultrasound evidence of vesicular microlithiasis, no biliary obstruction was confirmed. Other causes of liver injury were excluded and the diagnosis of DILI secondary to empagliflozin was made after liver biopsy. Complete clinical and laboratorial resolution was verified after empagliflozin withdrawal. Only two cases of DILI were reported since empagliflozin licensure which makes this case more interesting, alerting clinicians to an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",

            "resumo": "AbstractHypertriglyceridemia increases not only the cardiovascular risk but can also cause abdominal pain and recurrent pancreatitis when in very high levels. Familial chylomicronaemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease that affects chylomicron metabolism. FCS is most commonly caused by mutation of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene, which results in triglycerides 10 times higher than normal. The phenotypic resemblance makes the differential diagnosis with multifactorial chylomicronaemia very difficult, requiring genetic testing. Treatment has 2 goals: reducing cardiovascular risk as well as pancreatitis prevention. Volanevorsen is authorized for FCS treatment, acting by triglyceride clearance non-related to lipoprotein lipase. Phase 2 studies showed an apoC-III and TG reduction of 79.6% and 70.9% respectively; in phase 3 studies the TG reduction was 77% with minor adverse reactions. Data on the cardiovascular risk reduction are limited. We propose an algorithm for the approach of hypertriglyceridemia adapted to the Portuguese reality. Exclusion of secondary causes for hypertriglyceridemia begins in primary care; hospital referral is needed to confirm the diagnosis based on the score proposed by Moulinet alin 2018.",

The first step in the management of the patient with hyponatremia is the classification of the symptom’s severity which determines the urgency of the treatment. On one side, in very symptomatic hyponatremia, hypertonic saline must be immediately administered. On the other side, in asymptomatic patients or those with moderate symptoms, the underlying causes should first be investigated and removed/treated before any therapeutic intervention. The goal of this review is to discuss and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of hyponatremia, following the most recent recommendations",

Data on how this approach is performing in different hospitals is still scarce. Our aims were to characterize the main diagnoses of patients included in VVC and to evaluate the proportion of cases diagnosed with AMI.Material and Methods: A retrospective observational study was undertaken in the emergency department of a hospital from Alentejo (06/2017-05/2018). Patients were included if they were aged 18 or older and presented AMI-related symptoms. The main diagnosis was retrieved from medical records and the proportion of AMI was calculated. Data analysis was performed using uni- and bivariate statistics (IBM SPSS v.27.0).Results: A total of 338 patients were included, where 56.5% (n = 191) were male with a mean age of 63.9 ± 15.1 {19;96} years old. The majority of diagnoses were from the circulatory system (61.2%, n = 207). AMI was present in 27.2% (n = 92/338) of the sample. There were differences when comparing the number of risk factors between patients with AMI and non-AMI (2.83 ± 1.54 vs 2.06 ± 1.49 risk factors/patient, respectively; p < 0.001) and in patients with NSTEMI and STEMI (3.25 ± 1.36 vs 1.81 ± 1.50 risk factors/patient, respectively; p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference when analyzing the duration of pain between patients with AMI and non-AMI (6.24 ± 9.08 vs 10.53 ± 18.23 hours of pain, respectively; p = 0.032).Conclusion: Data suggest that the majority of diagnosis in VVC was related to the circulatory system, and a quarter of them were AMI.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate procedure success, use of echocardiogram, complications rate and usefulness for etiologic study of patients with pericardial effusion.Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of 55 pericardiocentesesis performed on 48 patients between January 2013 and December 2019 in an Intensive Care Unit from a peripheral hospital.Results and Discussion: It was assisted by echocardiography in 64% of cases, with a 100% success rate, 9.1% complications rate, and 12.7% recurrence rate. There was a greater number of punctures necessary for success, a higher rate of complications and greater severity of them when pericardiocenteses was not guided by echocardiography, which explains worse outcomes when compared to other series where echocardiography was used in every single procedure. Pericardial fluid analysis did not allow extrapolating Light criteria for pleural effusion, however there was a tendency for an association between classic exudate cases (neoplasia and infection) and higher LDH in pericardial fluid; ADA>50 U/L was very specific for tuberculous pericardial effusion. Most common etiology was neoplastic (33%, n = 16), with an average survival of 5.7 months in these patients, compared with 21.6 months in other causes.Conclusion: Echocardiogram-guided pericardiocenteses had a high success rate associated with a lower percentage of complications, which is why its use in all procedures is advocated. This technique has a main therapeutic goal in moderate to severe effusions, since it was not possible to obtain useful criteria to establish an etiological diagnosis.",

This exam is an additional tool in the management of the patient with microcirculation changes, mostly in cases due to suspected autoimmune disease.Methods: First 101 patients undergoing nailfold videocapillaroscopy in our hospital over an 18-month period, using a digital videocapillaroscope.Results: One hundred and one patients, 85% women, average age 50 years. The main reason for referencing was Raynaud´s phenomenon (93%). Capillaroscopic evaluation was suggestive of primary Raynaud´s phenomenon in 28 patients and secondary in 65.Discussion: The results described, although in a small sample, allow to reinforce the usefulness of nailfold videocapillaroscopy in the evaluation of patients with suspected microcirculatory dysfunction, especially in the context of autoimmune pathology. The early identification of individuals with a higher risk of progression to autoimmune disease will allow to optimize their follow-up, with regular surveillance, easy access to the medical team for an early detection of symptoms and regular laboratory evaluation.Conclusion: Nailfold videocapillaroscopy is an accessible and low-cost exam, which contributes together with laboratory results for the early identification of individuals with secondary Raynaud´s phenomenon. The future development of this technique may represent a predictor of disease progression.",

In order to contain the transmission alternative measures were adopted regarding care delivery to chronic diseases, namely through the use of telemedicine. Patient satisfaction with health care is associated with a better prognosis. In this study we intend to evaluate satisfaction with the provided health care in Internal Medicine telephonic appointments.Material and Methods: After performing a literature review we created a questionnaire to evaluate patient satisfaction with telephonic appointments. All patients with Internal Medicine telephonic appointments on September 2020 were included. The questionnaire was applied to the patient or to a family member.Results: The questionnaire was performed to 81 patients with an average age of 67.9 years and male predominance (53.1%). The questionnaire was answered by the patient himself in 71.6% of cases. Seventy patients (86.5%) agree/totally agree that telephonic appointments enabled health care that suited their needs and 88.8% agree/totally agree that it represents an acceptable way of health care delivery. The majority (74.1%) revealed satisfaction with telephonic appointments.Discussion and Conclusion: We present a new satisfaction questionnaire that showed a good reliability and can represent an important tool in the future.

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: Official data shows increased excess all- -cause mortality in 2020 compared to 2019. Fear of exposure constrained medical evaluations which were delayed by either choice or imposition. Going to the emergency department (ED) was no exception. Our objective was to compare demographic, clinical and analytical characteristics of patients who died in a COVID-19 dedicated ED with the same period of 2019.Material and Methods: Retrospective study analysing patient discharge notes who have died during ED permanence between March 18th and June 22nd of 2019 and in the same period of 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS software.Results: A total of 33 patients died in 2019 whereas 99 died in 2020 during the analysed period, representing a mortality rate of 0.34% and 1.89%, respectively. Only 4.04% (n = 4) of deceased patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, while all showed severe respiratory infections. There was a statistically significant difference concerning length of stay in ED (p < 0.01), being bedridden (p = 0.04), dementia (p = 0.03) and presence of respiratory failure at admission (p = 0.001). There were no differences regarding demographic data, comorbidities, and other analytical parameters.Conclusion: In 2020, deaths in the ED occurred among more vulnerable patients and with more severe disease. It was the later demand for hospital care, particularly in the worsening of chronic diseases, that irreversibly conditioned this outcome, especially in the context of chronic diseases exacerbation. Furthermore, the number of deaths that can be attributed to COVID-19 is negligible, deserving reflection and readaptation of good practices ensuring that patients are admitted to the ED within the recommended time and in accordance with the suspected pathologies.",

It presents with non-specific symptoms, such as low back pain, hematuria or varicocele, that lead to late diagnosis. We present the case of a 22-year-old patient with multiple episodes of high-intensity and recurrent low back pain, usually preceding the beginning of the catamenium. The imaging study of the vascular territory revealed anomalies in the left pelvic venous vasculature, with duplication of the homolateral renal vein, conditioning pelvic congestion. After several admissions (3 hospitalizations with diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis), the patient underwent angioplasty of the left renal vein with embolization of the gonadal vein. After a period of symptomatic resolution, there was symptomatic relapse associated with renal dysfunction, which conditioned the renal autotransplantation with insertion in the left iliac fossa. A high level of suspicion is essential, especially in the absence of response to conservative treatment and in the recurrence of symptoms without imaging findings suggesting other pathologies of an obstructive and / or inflammatory nature.",

The definition of prognosis in these patients becomes fundamental for the development of a personalized therapeutic plan (avoiding unnecessary therapies and/or investigations) for effective and adequate communication with the family to reduce the costs associated with the provision of care. Although several prognostic indexes exist in the literature, their applicability is difficult for several reasons. The authors of this article propose, therefore, as relevant data at the admission of a patient to the Internal Medicine ward, to facilitate the establishment of the prognosis and to allow a multidisciplinary approach plan, the following items: functional and cognitive status; prognosis- defining pathologies and frailty syndrome; surprise question at the emergency service; communication with the family.",

Being a medical emergency, a swift diagnosis and rapid institution of prognostic changing measures is of the utmost importance. This article aims at reviewing the most recent guidelines and more relevant data published in order to define the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of intracranial hemorrhage. After a quick diagnosis, the application of severity scales is crucial to the stratification of the risk and in the definition of the most suitable therapeutical strategy, including medical and surgical measures. Medical interventions can be divided as primary and secondary. Primary measures include aggressive control of the blood pressure, reversal of anti-coagulation and rapid evaluation for the need of surgical intervention. Secondary measures include body temperature control, normoglycemia and hemodynamic, mental status and intracranial pressure monitoring. Simultaneously with the therapeutic approach, diligences must be initiated to ensure the transference of the patient to the right level of care, since delaying this step is associated with worse prognosis. This article intends to create an auxiliary tool in giving the best possible care to the patients with intracranial hemorrhage.",

Assim, estaremos a empoderar os Internistas não apenas para abordar doentes, mas também para liderar e coordenar equipas em situações críticas, assegurando uma maior qualidade no cuidado ao doente.Os critérios de admissão definidos pelo CEMI, embora rigorosos, são o reflexo do elevado nível de responsabilidade exigido. A obrigatoriedade de experiência prática em SU, demonstração de competências técnicas diferenciadas e participação em formação e investigação na área, são essenciais para formar profissionais capazes de atuar nos vários cenários que são a complexidade das emergências médicas.Paralelamente, é defendido um equilíbrio entre a práticaassistencial na subespecialidade e nos restantes campos daMedicina Interna (internamento, consulta externa, entre outros), permitindo assegurar que o Internista subespecialista mantenha uma competência abrangente, o que beneficiará o doente ao longo das várias fases de evolução da doença.A subespecialidade em UEMA procura fortalecer o papel do Internista no sistema de saúde, permitindo garantir umaabordagem do doente de elevada qualidade em SU, e promovendo o crescimento profissional, através de recertificação e formação contínua.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: An Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme (AMSP) has been implemented in our hospital in the second semester of 2017. One of the goals was the reduction of the consumption of carbapenems and quinolones. This study aims to evaluate the evolution of the consumption of these drugs during the two years after implementing this programme. Methods: We analyzed the prescriptions of carbapenems and quinolones among inpatients between July 1st 2017 and June 30th 2019. The clinician reviewed each prescription and intervened, when necessary, directly with the prescriber. The consumption was calculated following the Nordic Council definition (2018 update) for the daily defined dose. Results: In the first year we identified 234 (35.0%) non- -conform prescriptions. Recommendations were addressed in 108 cases, of which 83.3% were accepted. The consumption of quinolones and carbapenems was reduced by 18.0% and 8.6%, respectively, relatively to the previous year. In the second year we identified 284 (34.5%) non-conform prescriptions. Recommendations were addressed in 215 cases, of which 94.0% were accepted. The consumption of quinolones and carbapenems was reduced by 55.7% and 10.3%, respectively. Discussion: Throughout this period, we found a reduction in the consumption of quinolones and carbapenems and an increase in compliance with the AMSP recommendations, reflecting a better education for prescription. This favors a more adequate use of antimicrobials, with lesser predisposal to the development of resistance. Conclusion: In our hospital, the AMSP is leading to a reduction in the use of carpabenems and quinolones, with good acceptance of the recommendations by the prescribers.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is a valid, albeit non-consensual option for the treatment of patients with Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF). The following article has the main goal of identifying predictors of therapeutic response to NIV.Methods: Retrospective longitudinal study which included patients in an Intensive Care Unit in 2016 and 2017, in whom NIV was started once they developed de novo ARF (PaO2/ FiO2 < 200). We included patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and compared NIV-responders to non-responders.Results: Between 2016 and 2017, 83 patients with de novo ARF were treated with NIV. Of those, 50 (60%) were treated successfully. The most common cause of ARF was CAP, which was successfully managed with NIV in 70% of cases. NIV-responders presented lower severity scores (APACHE 2; SAPS 2; SOFA) at admission (17.5; 37.5; 6 vs 22; 48; 9, p=0.014, p=<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively). Non-responders presented significantly lower arterial pH values at admission (7.35 vs 7.42, p<0.01), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (118 vs 145, p=0.03), higher seric lactate (2.2 vs 1.46, p<0.01) as well as need for vasopressor support (51.5% vs 30%, p=0.04). The change in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio within 2 hours of treatment was wider in the group of NIV-responders, unlike non-responders (+53, p<0.01 vs +14, p=0.09).Conclusion: NIV was an effective respiratory support strategy in 60% of patients with de novo ARF. Patients who seem to have a higher probability of NIV success are: patients with CAP; with or without moderate ARDS, rather than severe; with no respiratory acidaemia; patients with no lactacidemia or patients with no need for vasopressor therapy. The ability of NIV to significantly alter the PaO2/FiO2 ratio after 2 hours of technique seems to be a good success predictor.",

Autoantibodies could indicate symptoms, diagnostics and establish a more appropriate treatment. The relevance of searching Th/To and NOR90 is still unknown. We aim to evaluate major manifestations and disease associations of Th/To and NOR90 autoantibodies.Material and Methods: Observational retrospective single- centre study, including all patients with Th/To or NOR90 autoantibodies followed in autoimmune consultation from 2018 to 2020. Absence of specific clinical information excluded patients. Demographic, clinical and diagnostical data were analysed.Results: In this study, female gender was the most prevalent. Cutaneous, articular, cardiopulmonary and gastrointestinal involvements were present in both autoantibodies’ groups, with no renal manifestations. In 40% of both groups, systemic sclerosis diagnosis was established. No other concomitant autoantibodies were documented in 53% and 50% of anti-Th/To and anti-NOR90, respectively.Discussion and Conclusion: This study verified similar involvement in both groups with frequent skin and articular symptoms, more cardiopulmonary involvement in anti-Th/To group and more gastrointestinal association in anti-NOR90. Although, in this study, these autoantibodies were commonly related to systemic sclerosis, in approximately half of cases they were isolated with no other concomitant systemic sclerosis’ autoantibodies, enhancing the importance of their active research when this disease is suspected.",

We aim to describe the demographic characteristics, clinical course and outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to analyze risk factors for in-hospital mortality.Material and Methods: Ambispective cohort study of adult COVID-19 patients admitted to a Portuguese tertiary hospital between March and August 2020. Asymptomatic, pregnant and all patients admitted due to social reasons were excluded.Results: Of the 432 admitted patients, 279 individuals were included. The median age was 69 years and 57% were male. The most common comorbidities were high blood pressure (66.3%), dyslipidemia (33.3%), diabetes (27.1%) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (26.5%). The most common symptoms included fever (74.4%), cough (67.0%) and dyspnea (59.9%). Ferritin, C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels were elevated in 86.3%, 74.8% and 73.9% of patients, respectively. Mortality rate was 17.3%. 32.3% of the patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 31.9% were admitted to intensive care unit and 20.8% were ventilated.

This study aimed to make a narrative review on central post stroke pain (CPSP) including its definition, prevalence, clinical presentation, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment.Methods: A search was performed on PubMed© looking for articles in Portuguese or English, with full text, about human research, in adults, using the terms “central” and “pain” and “post stroke”. Thirty-three articles were included in this narrative review.Discussion: CPSP is a neuropathic pain syndrome resulting from an insult to the central nervous system. It is characterized by pain and sensory abnormalities, such as allodynia and hyperalgesia. Prevalence varies from 5% to 50% (thalamic stroke) and it is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Treatment includes mainly antidepressants and anticonvulsants, and a non- -pharmacological approach. The surgical approach is intended for refractory cases.Conclusion: Management of CPSP is challenging and requires an individualized approach. Future studies may clarify CPSP´s pathophysiology, define clear diagnostic criteria, and collect evidence that allows a more effective treatment.",

The subtle clinical presentation with micronutrient deficits and osteopenia or osteoporosis, associated with the medical underestimation of this hypothesis leads to its underdiagnosis in the elderly. Celiac disease in old age may have a higher risk of association with autoimmune, lymphoproliferative and cardiovascular diseases, with an impact on morbidity and mortality. Adherence to a gluten-free diet does not seem to be problematic and the quality of life does not appear to decrease. A multidisciplinary follow-up adapted to the patient is essential.

This infection is usually asymptomatic or mild, and only rarely is severe or critical, with lethality rates that are two to three times those of the seasonal flu. Nevertheless, the number of patients in need of admission to the hospital and of intensive care is variable from region to region, and might overwhelm the health system. Scientific evidence supporting the mitigation measures is scarce, and control groups inexistent, with data that shed doubt on real life effectiveness of lockdowns, contact tracing, disinfection of surfaces, objects and hands, school closures and mask use, on reducing the number of new cases. Interventions put in place to strengthen the hospital system might be insufficient and, in Portugal, there are no defined recommendations to avoid unbeneficial admissions to Intensive Care Units. A monitoring system to analyze the hospital system’s capacity and to adjust it to real time needs would be paramount, not only for the present pandemic, but also for future similar situations.",

The main objective of this study was to assess the opinions of medical students and interns about pre-graduate education in PC, and its contribution to the medical profession.Material and Methods: Qualitative study (online questionnaire) with descriptive treatment of the data. Participants were last-year students at Medical Schools of Portugal and first-year interns.Results: Of the 221 participants, 61% were students, the majority attended PC classes which lasted <8 hours. Participants considered the discipline of PC relevant for the medical education, but it should have a higher workload and should give the necessary knowledge to any general practitioner. There should be more education on symptoms of terminally ill patients, physical signs of imminent death, and communication of bad news. Participants revealed a good knowledge of the philosophy of PC and felt familiar with the main concepts of PC. Students did not have access to a practical, specialized environment for PC.Conclusion: In Portugal, although the pre-graduate education in PC is insufficient, it has had a positive effect, with high theoretical knowledge, but with little practice in PC. Medical Schools should invest more in pre-graduate education in PC, through the obligatory curriculum and regular clinical practices, empowering students for an empathic and compassionate relationship between the doctor and the patient in PC.",

The aim of our study is to identify the major reasons for that, the approach in the emergency department and the destination of these patients.Material and Methods: Descriptive study. All patients from primary health care (PHC) were selected at ARS Alentejo Central, referred to the emergency department (ED) of Hospital Espírito Santo de Évora, for the specialty of Internal Medicine, in the month of January and July 2017. To perform the statistical analysis, the Speed Statistics® (SPSS) was used.Results: About 15% of patients admitted to the emergency department are from PHC and 50% of these are forwarded for internal medicine. About 57% of patients have priority and the most frequent reason for referral is respiratory symptoms. A major conclusion carries out complementary diagnostic tests. It was found that 75% of the admitted patients were discharged to the home, 25% of whom had no acute pathology or had not been diagnosed in the ED.Discussion and Conclusion: More studies are necessary to identify the gaps in the path of the patient with acute pathology and what motivates the transfer of patients from PHC to ED. It is necessary to reflect and change the strategy, with the objective of improving the efficiency of the national health system, culminating in greater comfort for the patient. It would also be attractive to make multidisciplinary teams, in support of PHC, to discuss cases of acute pathology and decide on the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach. In this way, it would be possible to reduce the consumption of resources, creating a more patient-centred approach.",

D-dimer dosing has sensitivity of over 95% and high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of VTE. Our goal was to analyse every Emergency Department episode in which d-dimer dosing was performed. The variables analysed were: presence or absence of clinical symptoms suggestive of VTE, the suitability of D-dimer request according to pre-test probability scores, performance of computed tomography angiography (angio-CT) if D-dimer elevation and number of confirmed VTE.Methods: We performed a retrospectively analysis of all cases of patients over 18 years of age in whom D-Dimer dosing was performed in our Emergency Department from the 1st of July to the 31st of December of 2017.Results: 589 episodes were included in our analysis. Female gender represented 61% (n = 361) and median age was 62 ± 19 years-old. We documented 110 episodes with D-dimer dosing without any suggestive symptoms of VTE. In four patients with high pre-test probability D-dimer was inadequately performed. D-dimer elevation was observed in 55,5% (327/589) of all episodes, but only 28,1% were submitted to angio-CT. Total VTE confirmed was 27 (4,6%).Discussion and Conclusion: Our results are according to the literature. We report 3 main diagnostic errors: D-dimer dosing in patients without symptoms of VTE; D-dimer dosing in high probability patients; and patients with elevated D-dimer who do not do angio-CT. This study enlightens the prejudice of excessive and inadequate exams in the diagnosis of VTE.",

The mortality rate is very different among the countries, considering their age structure and the percentage of comorbidities. Elderly and people with underlying diseases are more susceptible to develop severe cases of COVID-19 and have higher case fatality rate. Cardiovascular diseases have a particular importance, given that their prevalence is elevated and considering the infection pathophysiology. Virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptors to invade the human cells. These receptors are mainly in the lungs and the heart. Besides the direct viral insult, hypoxia, cytokines storm and catecholamine’s liberation also affect these organs. In the heart, studies have shown that COVID-19 can cause myocarditis, ventricular arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and heart failure. Moreover, the cardiovascular insult may be the first manifestation of viral infection in some cases, which is a matter of increased concern during this pandemic. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are drugs of paramount importance in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, studies suggested concern about these medications in COVID-19 because they could cause an ACE2 upregulation and increase the severity of the infection. To the best of our knowledge, no study demonstrated that ACE inhibitors or ARB are harmful and the main cardiovascular societies are recommending the continuity of the treatment.",

The clinical management of HF is complex and the disease awareness and healthcare articulation need to be improved. HF patients are frequently hospitalized due to acute episodes. These hospital stays are excellent opportunities for the optimization of the HF clinical management. According to the international recommendations, checklists must be used by the medical staff when dealing with hospitalized HF patients, to improve the clinical outcomes of the disease, and hence, mitigate the clinical and financial impact of the disease. With this position statement the Study Group for Heart Failure (NEIC) from the Portuguese Society of Internal Medicine (SPMI) proposes the implementation of a checklist for the hospital discharge of HF patients in order to improve the clinical management of hospitalized HF patients in Portugal. The purposed checklist follows all the relevant international guidelines and recommendations for the management of HF, considering the Portuguese clinical practice, epidemiology and demography.",

In some countries, it has caused serious and simultaneous infections, in such a large number that several health systems disrupted. There are more doubts than certainties about its pathophysiology and treatment, but it is already clear that it is a systemic disease, which is initiated more often by respiratory symptoms No etiological treatment is known. Supportive treatment in the most severe cases is less effective than expected, requiring different strategies than we knew so far. The most effective attitudes so far are those that were recommended in the middle ages: social distancing, preven- tion of contacts and confinement. The pandemic makes humanity vulnerable as a whole, \"justifies\" massive restrictions on circulation and freedoms, precipitates an economic crisis of unknown proportions. No one knows what will happen in the future, to the survivors and to the possibility of recirculation of the virus. It is time to reflect the human condition and human relations. Society organization will change, and we will be protagonists.",

The US has been has been severely affected and remains the country with the highest recorded number of infections and deaths due to this corona virus. The heterogeneous distribution of cases appears to due to a number of factors: individualized responses across different states, a lack of a coherent federal policy, a lack of preparation, the climate of mis/dis-information and the politicization as a result of it occurring in an election year. Add to that a global worsening of health measures for many Americans including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, smoking among others. On the positive side, the scientific collaboration, the observations of astute clinicians and the continued efforts of the public health sector to re-direct the conversation towards scientific truths have played a good part in the fight against this infection. While there is a concern for the hype associated with incessant reporting of the news, let us try to find a common and safe path to live with this virus while protecting the older population and those at risk. Achieving herd immunity or effective vaccination will go a long way towards a return to a new kind of normality.",

In this review of the latest information on SARS-COV-2 immunobiology, we focused on the hypotheses that support a defective innate and acquired immunity to the virus, and the contribution of a dysfunctional immune response for the progression and mortality associated with the disease. Based on this new information, we point out the main immunotherapy strategies targeting the virus, the dysfunctional immune response and the disease prophylaxis (immunization). Improving our knowledge on the pathogen-host interactions will open the way to identify the best strategies for the diagnosis, treatment and control of COVID-19, as well as to the best preventive measures.",

The spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infections to progressive critical states, a direct upshot from the complex interplay between virus pathogenicity and host antiviral defense. This review focuses on the immunologic response and disarrangements underlying the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, gathering the information not only from the lessons learnt from SARS and MERS-CoV epidemics but also from what is already known about SARS-CoV-2 to date. This knowledge is paramount from the standpoint of disease prevention and control as well as di- agnostic pipeline and treatment.",

Health systems had to quickly adapt to a pandemic that challenged the resilience of states and society. We look at the consequences of the first phase of the pandemic in health systems reorganization (with limited access to care and priority shifted to COVID-19) and to the changes in the cardiovascular risk patients behaviour (such as isolation, fear of infection and anxiety). These indirect mechanisms may have contributed to cardiovascular disease under-diagnosis, or to the delay in diagnosis and treatment, and may have contributed to the increase in the registered mortality, even in people without SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: Neoplasia is considered the second disease with the highest morbidity and mortality. Hospital-level care is often unavoidable. The objective of Home Hospitalization (HH) is to minimize hospital complications and provide greater satisfaction to the patient and family/caregiver.Material and Methods: This article reports one year of HH experience at the Unidade Local de Saúde of Castelo Branco with regard to patients with oncological pathology.Results/Discussion: In the first year of HH, 99 patients were admitted, 22.2% (n = 22) of whom had oncological pathology. Sixty four percent were male and the average age was 65.9 years old (±12.8). The average hospital stay was 6.8 days (±3.4). Seventy seven percent had active cancer disease. The main existing neoplasias were: 31.8% lung, 22.7% hematological, 18.1% prostate and 13.6% breast. Of these, 58.8% were under chemotherapy and 17.6% had undergone recent surgery or radiation therapy. The main comorbidities found in these patients were: hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and chronic pain. The main reasons for hospitalization were: febrile neutropenia (36.3%), respiratory infection (27.2%) and pain control (13.6%). One patient died, one was transferred to hospital and three readmissions. Ninety days after discharge, 63.6% did not return to the hospital.Conclusion: Hospitalization in patients with neoplasia is very common. These are at increased risk of suffering from in-hospital infections, which increases mortality. The HH is advantageous because it reduces complications and provides a better quality of life for patients, given that they are undergoing qualified treatment in their own home.",

Our objective was to characterize the community-acquired UTI and antibiotic prescription patterns in two years.Material and Methods: Retrospective observational study, including patients evaluated in the first semesters of 2013 and 2015 with the diagnosis of community-acquired UTI, evaluated in the adult emergency department.Results: A total of 1981 diagnoses were identified, corresponding to 448 positive urine cultures. Escherichia coli was the most frequent bacterium, and there was a significant decrease in its prevalence between the two periods. There was a significant decrease in the resistance rate of Escherichia coli to ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole) and an increase in Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to nitrofurantoin. Nitrofurantoin, quinolones and cephalosporins showed global sensitivities greater than 90%. In the two-year period, the prescription of quinolones decreased while that of fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin increased.Discussion: The profile of Escherichia coli resistance to quinolones found in our study is lower than that previously documented in Portugal. Progress towards compliance with the national guideline has been made by decreasing the prescription of quinolones and co-trimoxazole, leading to an improvement in the profile of sensitivities to these antibiotics.Conclusion: Despite the declining trend in the prescription of quinolones, this class of antibiotics is still the most prescribed, requiring optimization of local prescription.",

Reports of isolated nodal lymphangioleiomyomatosis rare. Its treatment and prognosis are not well established. We describe a 48-year-old female patient presenting with ureter compression by an extensive retroperitoneal mass. Biopsy showed nodal lymphangioleiomiomatosis. A partial surgical resection of the lesions was performed. She is under yearly thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography control, last performed 3 years after diagnosis, with no lung involvement or new abdominal lesions. She evolved to menopause after 6 months. Some case series suggest that isolated nodal lymphangioleiomyomatosis may precede lung involvement by one to two years, having size as a risk factor (>10 mm). Relative stabilization of the disease course in postmenopausal women is described. This case reports an atypical evolution, with two >10mm diameter lesion, with 3-year follow-up without pulmonary, renal or other forms of lymphatic involvement.",

Our objective was to characterize the elderly population admitted to a convalescence unit and relate the nutritional status on admission with functional and health-related outcomes.Methods: All patients over 65 years old admitted to a convalescence unit during an 18-month period were analysed in regard to nutritional, functional and socio-familial status, risk of falling and risk of developing pressure ulcers.Results: Hundred eighty one patients, 57.5% females, aged 80.0±7.1 years old were included. Mini Nutritional Assessment classified 1/3 as undernourished and 66.3% as at risk for malnutrition. The great majority did not have a good socio-familial situation. Almost 2/3 had high risk of falling. Over 80% had no or mild risk for developing pressure ulcers. Over half were discharged home. Moderate correlations were found between nutritional status and both dependence for activities of daily living (ADL) and risk of developing pressure ulcers.Discussion: We found a high incidence of malnutrition, dependence for ADL, socio-familial problems and high risk of falling. We found a statistically significant relation between nutritional status and risk of developing pressure ulcers, constituting an important alert that nutritional evaluation and support may have a crucial role in people’s quality of life.Conclusion: Our findings are concerning and support the recommendations to routinely screen for malnutrition and provide nutritional support in all healthcare settings. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first survey of malnutrition and its implications carried out in a Portuguese convalescence unit.",

Patients with chronic use of urinary catheter and patients who were transferred to another institution were excluded.Results: In 193 patients with UC, 124 were improperly used in a certain time of the hospital stay, totalizing 1651 days of inappropriate UC. Traumatic hematuria was found in 8% and urinary retention after catheter removal was found in 9% of cases. Catheter associated urinary tract infection was diagnosed in 41 patients (21%) and in 14 of these patients there was no formal reason for UC.Discussion/Conclusion: The rate of UC (47%) was significantly higher than that found in other similar studies and the time of inappropriate catheterization was overly prolonged.

The meaning and the classifications of patients with this elevation (myocardial injury, either acute or chronic, versus acute myocardial infarction, either type 1 or type 2) remains unclear. The aim of our study was to assess the meaning and to classify the patients admitted to an internal medicine department with an elevated troponin level.Material and Methods: A clinical retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients admitted to an internal medicine department was conducted over a 2-year period. We identified patients with at least 2 troponin I measurements, and at least 1 above 0.1 ng/mL. Population was characterized according to demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis. Troponin elevation was interpreted according to the fourth univer-sal definition of myocardial infarction.Results: A total of 90 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 83 years ((± 8.1), 52% were male. Sixty patients (66%) had myocardial infarction criteria, and the remaining 30 patients (33%) were classified as acute myocardial injury, without infarction. We found no clinical difference between these patients, except for age, which was higher in myocardial infarction patients (84 ± 7 vs 81 ± 10 years, p = 0.039). Patients had a high disability score (43% had an ECOG 3 or 4), hypertension (89%), heart failure (51%), type 2 diabetes (50%), chronic kidney failure (35%), atrial fibrilation or flutter (35%) and had had a previous myocardial infarction (33%). Clinical presentation included dyspnea (44%) and chest pain (13%). On discharge, pa-tients were prescribed a statin (64%) and antiplatelets (58%). In-hospital mortality was 17%, while 30 days and 1 year mortality were 27% and 51% respectively.Conclusion: In this study, in a real-world cohort of patients admitted to an Internal Medicine department over a 2-year period, troponin levels were analyzed in 9%, and acute myocardial injury was found in one third of those patients. These patients had criteria for acute myocar-dial infarction in 66% and of acute myocardial injury without infarction in 33%. Age was higher in myocardial infarction patients, whilst there were no differences in other clinical, management or prognostic features. Patients were elderly and fragile, with a higher prevalence of several comorbidities, when compared with studies based on Cardiology departments. Mortality was high, with half the patients dying within a year, even with the prescription of statins in 64% and antiplatelets in 60%.",

Advanced age and comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, have been associated with a worse prognosis. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of diabetes and metabolic control on Emergency Department (ED) admission in patients with COVID-19 with hospitalization criteria.Methods: Clinical and laboratorial features were assessed through ED clinical file consultation of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at CHTV. The data included inflammatory and metabolic profile, personal history and chronic medication.Results: Eighty nine patients were included, 38.2% women and 61.8% men, with a mean age of 73.23 years ± 16.26. 29.2% patients had a previous diabetes diagnosis, 53.4% hypertension and 29.5% cardiac insufficiency. The overall mortality was 14.6%, 7.86% of the patients were admitted to the iIntensive Care Unit and there were no significant differences between the groups (diabetic versus non-diabetic). The average HbA1C was 6.96% and there was a positive and significant correlation between the blood glucose values and lactate, C-reactive protein and leukocyte values.Conclusion: Higher blood glucose levels at ED admission appear to be associated with more severe inflammatory states and may also explain some of the variance in lactate and leukocyte values. The diabetic population had good metabolic control, which may clarify the absence of significant differences in severity and mortality between groups.",

It was confirmed acute ischemia and high levels of myocardial lesion markers. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with favourable evolution. Anaphylaxis cases reported due to PPI are exceedingly rare; the mechanism is IgE-mediated, with class effect and possibility of cross reaction with ranitidine. Kounis’s syndrome represents an association of acute myocardial infarction type 2 with anaphylactic shock. Despite seldom, due to a general use of PPI, this side effect should be considered, especially with intravenous administration.",

It is characterized by peripheral nerve hyperexcitability with muscle hyperactivity and deficient relaxation, and it is frequently accompanied by autonomic and sensitive symptoms. The diagnosis is established by electromyography, showing spontaneous, multiple single motor unit discharges, firing at a high frequency. The diagnosis is relevant not only to achieve symptom control but also for its known association with neoplasia, which must be ruled out. Nevertheless, the diagnosis is difficult to establish due to the nonspecific and variable symptoms that may lead to confusion with the more common psychiatric or motor neuron diseases. Misdiagnose can result in incorrect therapeutic actions with further iatrogenic symptoms. We report a typical case of neuromyotonia, in respect of which we review the clinical presentation, complementary diagnostic methods, natural evolution and treatment of the disease.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: Diabetes mellitus prevalence in palliative patients tends to rise. The therapeutic goal guided strategies commonly used in diabetic patients are inadequate in the context of palliative care. Actually, these strategies may compromise the principles of well-being and quality of life by focusing on the prevention of long-term complications. The issues in this context are numerous. What is the target value of adequate metabolic control? Does HbA1C-based disease control remain acceptable? What drugs should we prefer in these patients? Our purpose is to review up-todate literature concerning the best practices in managing diabetes mellitus on a terminal ill patient.Methods: At November 2019, we searched review articles, observational studies, guidelines, and opinion articles with the terms “palliative care” and “diabetes mellitus” published in the last 10 years, in English, Spanish and Portuguese, on the databases: Medline / PubMed, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Scienc- Direct.Results: When managing diabetes mellitus in a terminally ill patient, it is imperative to keep in mind the ultimate clinical goal for the patient: to prevent acute complications of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Most studies report that HbA1C monitorization has little relevance. Screening for capillary glycemia should be reduced or abolished. If performed, values between 108 and 270 mg / dL should be tolerated if the average life expectancy is months or values between 180- 360 mg/dl if the average life expectancy is weeks or days. To establish an individualized therapeutic plan, the palliative care team should take into account several characteristics of the patient and caregivers. Every change should represent an effort to simplify therapeutic schemes. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of each drug, side effects and potential for hypoglycemia should be considered. Strict avoidance of sugary food is not necessary.",

The second mistake is to believe that one knows but one does not know; namely to believe that in “knowledge institutions” (orga- nizations intensive in know-how) what counts is the scientists and technicians’ know-how and not the organization to make them most productive. To facilitate their work.Thus, the questions: could it be that leadership does not apply to knowledge institutions (in general) and health ones (in particular)? Why? And what is leadership? And why did Peter Drucker, founder of modern management, say that leadership both does not exist, and it is fundamental? How can that be?Let us start by the beginning.",

The European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q) is the most recently validated in Europe, it has a validated Portuguese version and it categorizes 4 different degrees of health literacy (excellent, sufficient, problematic and insufficient). Lower degrees of literacy are associated with worse incidence and severity of illness, hospital- ization rates and higher morbidity and mortality. The goal was to assess the health literacy level in relation to healthcare.Material and Methods: Application of the Portuguese ver- sion of the HLS-EU (HLS-PT) questionnaire to patients admitted to internal medicine care. All patients admitted to the internal medicine ward were initially included. Exclusion criteria were evidence of cognitive or clinical inability to answer the questionnaire.Results: 64 patients were surveyed. Study population was mostly male (57%) with an average age of 71 years, retired (71.8%) and with low level of education (56.2% with academic education up to junior school). The majority (68.7%) had a prob- lematic or insufficient health literacy.Conclusion: Although the authors recognize that both the environment of the questionnaire application and the demographic characteristics of this study differ from the national and European study, it is a disturbing result regarding health literacy in hospitalized individuals with chronic diseases.",

The ageing population and the increasing in chronic diseases prevalence in advanced stage, progressive and debilitating diseases, provides increasingly demand of health care services and hospitalization, implying increased spending if such patients are not identified as palliative. The present study aims to assess the need for Palliative Care (PC) in patients hospitalized in an internal medicine department.Methodology: A retrospective and observational study is presented, including patients aged ≥ 60 years, for a period of three months. It was applied the Palliative Care Screening Tool scale (PCST) in order to identify the potential candidates for Palliate Care (score ≥ 4).Results: Three hundred and twenty-eight patients were admitted, but only 288 (88%) were evaluated and 54% of them presented score ≥ 4 points at PCST scale, eligible for PC. In this group, the average age was 82 years; 54% women and 46% men. Admission median was 11 days. The main co- morbidities were dementia in 47%, stroke in 45% and chronic kidney disease in 39%. The appreciation of psychological problems was not recognized. The mortality rate was 31% and only one patient was admitted in PC unit.Conclusion: This study testifies that PC patients are hos- pitalized in Internal Medicine Services, and it also shows the importance of specific training of internists as well as research in this particular area and the use of specific scales with the potential to identify these patients.",

Research on the epi- demiologic history might help to understand the phenomenon and guide intervention strategies. Objectives: (1) Describe historic trends in mortality. (2) Estimate the impact of demographic variations on the registered number of cases.Methods: (1) We calculated rates, specific and standard- ized, for deaths registered as CVD (ICD-10: I60-I69, G45; ICD- 8/9: 430-438; ICD-6/7: 330-334) by sex (1902-2012) and by sex and age groups (1913-2012). We used Join point analysis to identify statistically significant changes in standardized death rates, and multivariate regression models, Poisson and negative binomial, controlling for demographic dynamics and time trend, from 1913 to 2012. (2) We calculated the contribution of demographic variations using the application RiskDiff. (3) We evaluated if changes in coding rules might have been a source of bias. Data source: National Institute of Statistics.Results: (1) We gathered the longest and most discriminated mortality series from CVD in Portugal with data since the beginning of nationwide collection. Mortality increases exponentially with age and is higher in men. (2) We observed sig- nificant variations in age-standardized time trends (1913-1933: APC 2.0%; 1933-1955: APC -0.9%; 1955-1974: 2.9%; 1974- 1996: -2.4%; 1996-2012: -6.5%). (3) Population ageing exerted a significant pressure to increase the number of deaths, particularly in the second half of the twentieth century. However, this effect was counterweighted by protective factors.Conclusion: CVD mortality in Portugal is particularly expressive when compared to other European countries, although significant gains have been observed in the last decades. Population ageing combined with a transition between the morbid and mortality dimensions changed the public health paradigm.",

STOPP/START criteria are a tool aiming to improve elderly medication appropriateness that has shown good validity, interrater reliability and applicability.Our aim was to evaluate the impact of the application of STOPP/START criteria version 2 to the prescription of hospitalized elderly patients.Methods: A prospective, single-centre study carried out in a tertiary internal medicine ward. Patients admitted with 65 years or more and with 5 or more medications were randomized to receive either usual physician and pharmacist care (control) or providing the patient ́s attending medical team, within the first 72 hours, a pop-up recommendation indicating potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) and potentially prescribing omissions (PPO) as a result of the application of the STOPP/START version 2 criteria (intervention). Statistical analysis done with SPSS version 23 considered a p <0.05.Results: 156 patients were included and random- ized, and 64 on the intervention group and 62 on the con- trol group were analysed. The team observed an average PIM and PPO reduction of 49% and 31% in the intervention group versus 13% and 0% in the control group (p = 0.01). There was an average acceptance of 63% for STOPP and 40% for START criteria recommendations. In the overall population the team found a prevalence of polypharmacy of 21% and of inappropriate prescription (at least one PIM) of 75.4% and identified a total of 230 PIM and 153 PPO.Conclusion: The team reports a high prevalence of polypharmacy and inappropriate prescription among Portuguese elderly patients admitted to an internal medicine ward. The latter was significantly reduced using pop-up recommendations reporting the application of STOPP/START version 2 criteria within 72 hours of admission.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is one of the most prevalent causes of observation in the emergency department in an ageing population. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has shown good results in critically ill with ARF. The evidence of NIPPV outcomes in old patients is scarce. The aim of our study is to analyse outcomes of NIPPV use in this population.Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study in a 12-bed intermediate care unit of an university hospital. We included and consecutively compared patients aged 75 years old or more (study group) and under 65 years old (control group) submitted to NIPPV due to ARF. The primary endpoint was mortality (in-hospital and 30 days after discharge). Secondary endpoints were NIPPV settings, complications, and failure rate.Results: A total of 109 patients were included. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the study group (22.2 % vs 8.1%, p< 0.01). However, mortality 30 days after discharge was not significantly different (4.1% vs 4.9%, p = 0.37). NIPPV duration of use (6.1 vs 2.2 days, p < 0.01) and hospital length of stay (14.3 vs 6.2 days, p = 0.01) were higher in the study group. NIPPV failure (22.2% vs 16.1 %, p = 0.09) and complication rate (intolerance 8% vs 6%, p = 0.31; ulcers 4% vs 3%, p = 0.28) were similar in both groups.Conclusion: ARF carries a grim prognosis in older adults. A high mortality rate was observed in older patients despite similar severity assessments and NIPPV failure and complication rates. Notably, out of the hospital mortality is comparable between both groups.",

Additional workup concluded pancytopenia (Hb 6.4 g/dL; Htc 19%; leuc 2600/L; plat 126000/L), macrocytosis (VGM 113 fL), hyperbilirubinemia (total 2.64 mg/dL), prolonged prothrombin time (INR 1.47), hypoalbuminemia (2.8 mg/dL) and fibrotic changes in hepatic architecture on ultrasound. Upon thorough examination, an extensive purpuric lesion on both lower limbs associated with perifollicular haemorrhagic papules, corkscrew hair, gingival hypertrophy, and lack of teeth was noted. Even though it is rarely seen nowadays, the semiology findings suggested vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency, known as scurvy. This diagnosis was confirmed via laboratory testing that quantified seric vitamin C <1 mg/L (ref value 2-15 mg/dL), as well as vitamin B12 value of 186 ng/L (ref value 193-982 ng/L) and folic acid value of <1ng/mL (ref value 3-17 ng/mL). Vitamin supplementation and healthy nutrition were begun showing a favourable outcome with hematoma, purpura, and pancytopenia regression. The clinical manifestations of vitamin deficiency, like scurvy, can be vast and overlooked, if this outdated diagnosis is not considered, leading to unnecessary investigation and erroneous diagnoses.",

In Portugal, there is a shortage of measuring instruments to assess the physical performance of these patients. The Physical Performance Test (PPT) scale evaluates functionality. The aim of the study is to validate both versions of the scale - PPT-7 and 9 items - for elderly with dementia in the Portuguese population.Materials and Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was performed. Of the 96 individuals evaluated, 60 met the inclusion criteria: age ≥ 65 years; Dementia diagnosis with assessment by Mini Mental State Examination between 10 and 24 points. The ethical procedures of the Helsinki Decla- ration have been complied with. Data collection took place in eight institutions.Results: Cronbach’s alpha was 0.79 (evaluator 1 and 2) in the PPT-9 items and 0.69 (evaluator 1) and 0.70 (evaluator 2) in the PPT-7 items. The values of test-retest reliability var- ied between 0.65 and 0.72 (evaluator 1) and 0.52 and 0.91 (evaluator 2), except for item 3. The values inter-rater reliability exceeded 0.95. For the PPT-9 and PPT-7 items, the correlation was 0.99. The convergence of the PPT-9 items with the IB is 0.65 and the PPT-7 items is 0.64.Discussion: Cronbach ́s alpha coefficients revealed good levels of reliability. Both versions have good reproducibility, high interobserver agreement and moderate convergence with IB.Conclusion: The Portuguese version of the PPT-7 and 9 items is reliable and valid for the elderly with dementia.",

Despite recent treatment improvements, information is scarce regarding etiology and prognosis. Our aim was to determine the incidence of pericarditis with a known etiology and assess clinical prognostic predictors.Material and Methods: A clinical retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients with acute pericarditis was conducted from 2012 to 2016. Population was characterized according to etiology, clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis. Outcomes of interest, evaluated at one year after hospital discharge, were pericarditis recurrence, hospitalization, constric- tion and overall mortality.Results: A total of 94 patients were enrolled, median age 46 years (inter-quartile range 32-61), 65% were male. Idio- pathic etiology was responsible for 68% of cases. A specific etiology was found in the remaining 32% of patients, being the most frequent autoimmune disease (12%) and malignancy (5%). Idiopathic pericarditis was associated with myopericarditis (p = 0.049) and a known etiology with pericardial effusion (p = 0.001) and cardiac tamponade (p = 0.027). Recurrence of pericarditis was found in 13% of patients. Corticosteroid treatment in patients with an identified etiology was not associated with an increase in recurrence (p = 0.220). Overall 1-year mortality was 9%. A defined etiology was the only independent predictor of mortality at multivariate analysis (OR 40.3; 95% CI 1.9 – 137.2; p = 0.016).Conclusion: Up to one third of hospitalized patients with acute pericarditis have an identified cause of pericarditis and these patients are at increased risk of mortality.",

Ages varied from 26 to 78 years, median of 54.5. Ketamine was used as an adjuvant treatment for opioid-refractory cancer pain in 18 patients, and in two to treat depression. In the first group all patients had unbearable pain and 22% showed signs of opioids adverse effects; 73% had mixed pain. They were treated with high doses of opioids-equivalent to a median dose of 422.5 mg/ day of oral morphine. The average dose of ketamine was 85 mg/ day, median 80 mg/day, in continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion in 90% of them. The dose of opioid decreased in 12% and the rescue opioid dose in 53%. In 70% the pain was relieved. Improvement in pain was found in an average of 4.8 days. All received neuroleptics with or without benzodiazepines. The psychotomimetic side effects in one patient forced to discontinue ketamine. Patients with depression demonstrated an improve- ment in mood as the main response to a single dose of ketamine.Conclusion: The results of this study showed ketamine efficiency in subanaesthetic doses to help control the cancer pain. Despite being a promising therapeutic approach in palliative care units more research must be carried out to define the role of ketamine in Palliative Care.",

We present the clinical case of a 79-year-old female patient, with outdated tetanus vaccine, admitted in the context of an injury to the left wrist, without prophylaxis with tetanus immunoglobulin. Reassessed in the emergency 5 days after the event with trismus, opisthotonos, respiratory failure and dysautonomia. We proceeded to wound cleaning, immunoglobulin and antibiotic therapy administration, sedation, ventilatory support and we transferred the patient to an intensive care unit. It was a case without prophylaxis, showing that tetanus is still a threat that should alert us all to the immunological situation and compli- ance with the national vaccination plan.",

Other atherogenic paths seem to be influenced, such as chylomicron remnants removal from circulation, oxidative and inflammation profile, blood fluidity and intestinal microbiota. Furthermore, imaging methods have shown better structural and functional vas- cular properties among vegetarians. However, a non-balanced vegetarian diet might lead to nutrients deficit, which could nullify these advantages. These limitations may be overcome through a carefully planned diet and, in some cases, supplements or fortified foods. Ultimately, a beneficial effect is associated with a healthy vegetarian concept, with scarce intake of refined and processed food products, avoiding overconsumption of sugar and trans fats.Conclusion: Vegetarian diet brings a positive impact in sever- al independent cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the additional challenge in reaching specific macro and micronutrients which are less available in plant-based foods, their shortage can be avoided by planning a well-balanced and complete diet, based on healthy and natural food components. As there is the acknowledgment of its limitations and corresponding precautions are taken, a vegetarian diet could be used as an effective weapon towards prevention and management of cardiovascular disease.",

Time to symptom relief is measured in 24-48 hours or weeks to months after the completion of radiotherapy. The optimal rate of radiotherapy use in the final months of life is unclear; therefore, its use must be judicious. But would incorporate anticipated efficacy in patients whose survival allows it and minimize overuse among patients with expected short survival. Studies have shown that oncologists overestimate patient survival times of patients with advanced cancer and expose terminally ill patients to the burden of longer fractionated courses of radiotherapy with no further benefits. Prognostic indices can help with estimations of survival length and may assist to guide treatment decisions regarding palliative radiotherapy in patients with potentially short survival times. This review intends to highlight the advantages and role for palliative radiotherapy in end-of-life oncology care.",

The disease is characterized by fever, headache, rash and arthralgia with an acute unset. Arthralgia may progress and become persistent. Atypical manifestations, severe but rare, include neurologic disease. It is associated with morbidity, due to persistent arthralgia, and mortality. The diagnosis is performed by polymerase chain reaction or by IgM and IgG antibodies detection. There is no effective antiviral treatment, and therefore supportive care is recommended to relieve symptoms.

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: Actinomycosis is a chronic bacterial infec- tion that rarely affects the respiratory system. Lung infection usually develops after aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal secretions. Typically, it presents with pneumonia, lung abscess or empyema, and the most common radiologic presentation is a pulmonary mass, simulating a tumour. Adequate treatment requires prolonged antibiotic therapy to prevent relapse. In this article we made a literature review on actinomycosis and analysed patients’ data from Pedro Hispano Hospital.Methods: Medical records from twelve-year data (January 2006 - December 2017) on pulmonary actinomycosis were consulted. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively collected and analysed.Results: Five patients were diagnosed with pulmonary actinomycosis, three males and two females. Mean age was 55 years. The most frequent microorganism was Actinomyces meyeri, identified in bronchoalveolar lavage in one case, and pleural fluid samples in other two cases. The other patients had isolation of Actinomyces odontolyticus and Actinomyces spp. All presented favourable response to treatment except for one patient, who died from empyema with septic shock. In one case, after a good therapeutic response, there was abandonment of the consultation and follow-up could not be maintained.Conclusion: Presently, actinomycosis is a rare disease with good prognosis if diagnosed early and treated appropriately. It should always be considered as a differential diagno- sis of a persistent parenchymal lung lesion.",

Although mostly benign, it can be fatal especially in older anticoagulated patients. We aim to study the occurrence and clinical presentation of this entity, focusing on its relationship with anticoagulant therapy.Material and Methods: Retrospective case series of patients admitted to an Internal Medicine Unit of a tertiary university hospital and revision of the literature. Patients with the diagnosis of rectus sheath hematoma from 2010 to 2018 were included.Results: In the study period, there were nine cases of rectus sheath hematoma in 14 730 admissions, with median age of 78 ± 9 years, of which 6 were women. All patients presented with spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma. Forty-four percent were severe, according to the Classification of Berná, and the mortality rate was 11%. Abdominal pain and a fall in the haemoglobin level (mean of 3.7 ± 1.8 g/dL) were the most common clinical manifestations and diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography. All patients were under anticoagulants. Those treated with dicoumarins had a supratherapeutic INR (mean 6.0 ± 2.6) and a precipitating factor (cough), contrary to those under low-molecular weight heparin. Anticoagulation was reversed in 6 cases. Five patients were discharged under anticoagulants and had no rectus sheath hematoma recurrence.Discussion/Conclusion: Rectus sheath hematoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with abdominal pain under anticoagulant therapy. Although a rare complication, it can have a fatal outcome. Efforts to guarantee a correct administration of low-molecular weight heparin, rigorous INR control and high clinical suspicion with early diagnosis are nec- essary to avoid it.",

There is a lack of knowledge among healthcare professionals and caregivers regarding the best feeding approach in patients with advanced dementia. As there are no national recommendations on this subject, a consensus report from the Portuguese Society of Internal Medicine and the Portuguese Enteral and Parental Nutrition Society was made, clarifying existing guidelines regarding the approach of eating difficulties in these patients.Advanced dementia is a terminal condition where patient comfort should be the goal. These patients are usually bedbound, have limited ability to communicate verbally and have difficulty eating. In this population, current literature does not support tube feeding (nasogastric tube, nasojejunal tube, percutaneous gastrostomy or percutaneous jejunostomy feeding), which is associated with higher rates of infection, greater use of chemical and physical restraints and development of pressure ulcers. As an alternative, careful hand feeding should be offered (comfort feeding). From an ethical and legal standpoint, it is acceptable not to use tube feeding in the terminal phase of dementia if it is against patient values and offers no benefits. This decision should be made using a multidisciplinary approach including the patient (if possible), legal representative, caregivers, family and healthcare professionals, in order to establish an individual care plan allowing decision making in the patient’s best interest.",

Clinical manifestations and symptoms maybe difficult to interpret. Although inflammation may prevail,the state of immunosenescence makes the infectious disease pauci-symptomatic and different from usual. Adynamia,fever, and cough, are often interpreted and medicated as infection. Besides, although infection is common at the end oflife, it is often a marker of gravity and not the problem itself.Antibiotics, usually used in this context, may not serve thebest interests of the patient and contribute to the development of resistant microorganisms, which has negative implications at the community level.

Patients were evaluated using the MNSI (MichiganNeuropathy Screening Instrument) and the SWME (10 gSemmes-Weinstein monofilament examination). A score > 2in the clinical examination of MNSI or ≤ 7 positive answers ina total of 10 in SWME were considered diagnostic of DSPN.Results: Eighty-eight patients were included; average agewas 77 (13) years and 45% were males; most were type 2 diabetic patients, 7% had a previous diagnosis of DSPN. DSPNprevalence was 75% using MNSI, SWME was abnormal in 38%of these patients. The agreement rate between MNSI and SWMEwas 44.3%. A percentage of 92.4% of the patients with a diagnosis of DSPN in the study did not have a previous diagnose.Discussion: The number of underdiagnosed cases in thisstudy is alarming but had been previously detected in studiesregarding outpatient; it might represent a problem of registryor an omission in the screening of neuropathy.Conclusion: We have concluded that DSPN is a highprevalent disease in hospitalized patients in Portugal, whichremains underdiagnosed.

There was a 3.9 average of comorbidities, medication reconciliation was present in 47% and in 61%there was at least one medication discrepancy or error. Themedication error most frequently encountered was the introduction error.Discussion and Conclusion: The high prevalence of medication discrepancies and of non- medication reconciliation is inpart due to the inexistence of a systematic process for collecting pharmacological history, poor doctor-patient communication and the lack of medication reconciliation procedure. Thehigher prevalence of introduction errors may be due to copypaste of previous and out of date pharmacological records.There is a need for prospective studies that evaluate the medication reconciliation influencing factors, the medication errorsand its short and long-term consequences.",

A rare but potentially serious adverse effect of statins’ therapy has been described– anti-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (anti-HMGCR) immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) – that can occur years after the drug has beenstarted. We conducted a literature review after illustratinga typical case of anti-HMGCR IMNM. A 67-year-old femaletreated with simvastatin for the past 5 years presented withproximal myalgias and tetraparesis, raised creatine kinase,a myopathic pattern on electromyogram, a necrotizing myopathy on muscle biopsy and anti-HMGCR antibodies. Thestatin was stopped, and immunosuppressive therapy wascommenced, leading to a complete remission. The distinction between anti-HMGCR IMNM and other myopathies iscrucial, so that the appropriate treatment can be startedpromptly. Likewise, it is important that clinicians be awareof this entity",

It ismainly characterized by neurological symptoms, such asparesthesias, incoherent speech, ataxia, dyspnoea, apnoea,which can culminate in death from respiratory paralysis. Toprevent this syndrome from taking place, periodic monitoringof paralytic shellfish poisoning biotoxins is mandatory beforebivalves are harvested for commercialization. However, ignorance or disrespect of the harvest bans in force has led tosporadic poisonings that required hospitalization. For severaldecades the occurrence of high contamination levels withthese biotoxins in bivalves of the Iberian Atlantic coast hasoccurred in decadal-like intervals. These years of very hightoxicity have coincided with years in which solar activity (derived from the 11-year sunspot cycle) is at its minimum. Theseasonality of this contamination is more severe in the autumn and known hospital admissions have also occurred inthe autumn.",

The primary objective of thispaper was to assess the impact of the reduction or loss ofautonomy of the elderly patients in the nosocomial infectionacquisition.Material and Methods: Prospective analysis of hospitalizedpatients from March 2017 to February 2018 at the Department of Internal Medicine of Vila Real Hospital, with an evaluation of the dependence level through the Katz scale andnosocomial infection acquisition. Other variables were analyzed: compromised systems and risk factors in nosocomialinfections, mean duration of hospitalization, mortality and readmission.Results: A total of 1311 patients were analyzed, with a meanage of 83.2. Of the patients’ sample, 33.6% were autonomous, 32.6% were partially dependent and 33.7% were totally dependent. Nosocomial infection was observed in 10.6%of patients. There was a statistically significant associationbetween the dependence level and the nosocomial infections acquisition, as well as between the presence of nosocomial infection and mortality, and readmission after 30 days.The dependence level was also significantly associated withdays of hospitalization, with mortality and with readmission.Discussion and Conclusion: This study revealed that nosocomial infection development was superior in patients witha greater dependence level as well as the mortality, whichwas also higher in this subgroup of patients. In this way, theloss of autonomy should be considered as a predisposingpotential for acquisition of infection.",

Prolonged hospitalizations were classified as appropriate if due to complex clinicalpresentation, complications or iatrogenies, and inappropriate if related to lack of post-discharge conditions.Results: One hundred and seventy seven prolonged hospitalizations (10.4% of all admissions); 53 men, mean age 76years. Average 33.8 days of hospitalization; 39% had previous clinical discharge – 1653 days of postponed discharge.At admission, 36% were partial and 17% totally dependent.Comorbidities: hypertension (75%), cerebrovascular disease(52%), diabetes (35%), dementia (28%). Prevalent main diagnoses: stroke (21%), pneumonia (14%), neoplasia (11%);14% required intensive/intermediate care units.

TheModified Early Warning Score (MEWS) identifies patientsat high risk of clinical deterioration, admission to ICU andintra-hospital mortality when done at the Emergency Roomor at the ward. We tested MEWS as a predictor of early readmissions to the ICU when done at the moment of dischargefrom these Units.Material and Methods: We conducted a case-control study(1:1) comparing patients with early readmissions with controls without readmissions to a polyvalent ICU, during a period of 9 years. Logistic regression was used to determine thediscriminative power of MEWS to predict early readmissionsto the ICU. The predictive precision of the score was calculated by the area under the receiver operating characteristiccurve.Results: We paired 114 patients with early readmission (rateof 1.5%) with 114 controls. Any value of MEWS > 0 was associated with a significant increase in the risk of early readmission. A value of MEWS = 0 showed a negative predictivevalue of 99.7%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the MEWS to the prediction of early readmissions was 0.69 (IC95%: 0.62-0.76; p < 0.001).Discussion: The predictive precision of MEWS to this purpose was higher than other scores reported in the literature.Conclusion: MEWS is an easy clinical score with the potentialto increase patient safety at the moment of discharge fromthe ICU.",

They affect 5/100000 people per year in Portugal, among which more than60% will become transfusion-dependent during the courseof the disease. Cytopenias may lead to significant morbidityand their correct management is the key to maintain thesepatients’ quality of life. This document gathers the result ofthe debate promoted by the Anemia Working Group Portugalwith experts on the management of patients with lower riskMDS, addressing the medium- and long-term effects of recurrent transfusion and iron overload. For the diagnosis of MDS,the group recommends the use of World Health Organizationclassification published in 2016. The International PrognosisScoring System score is still the reference score to defineboth the prognosis and the therapeutic strategy. Supporttherapy is a fundamental cornerstone in the managementof MDS patients at any stage of the disease, and includesantibiotics, transfusion of erythrocytes and platelets, hematopoietic growth factors, antifibrinolytic agents and chelators.Chelation therapy should be considered in patients transfused with ≥ 20 units of erythrocytes or with serum ferritin ≥1000 ng/mL. Patients who are candidates to chelation shouldbe submitted to periodic magnetic resonance imaging to theliver and the pancreas. Therapeutic options should take intoaccount the individual characteristics of the disease for everypatient and preserve the quality of live, in accordance withinternational guidelines.",

We performeddescriptive analysis and inferential statistics. The analysis included the door-to-doctor time (since the hospital admissionto the clinical evaluation), the door-to-computed tomography(CT) time (since the hospital admission to the CT scan completion) and the door-to-needle time (since the hospital admission to the fibrinolysis).Results: Thirty-eight fibrinolysis were carried out. The inferential analysis revealed no statistically significant differences. The median of the door-to-doctor time (00h06m versus00h07m) and door-to-CT time (00h32m versus 00h31m) weresimilar in both years. The door-to-needle time has improvedin the second year (median 1h15m versus 00h52m).Discussion: We have seen improvement in the door-to-needletime in the second year, fulfilling, in most cases, the timesrecommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

The data about oncological inpatients with febrile neutropenia is scarce on literature, so this study pretends to characterize this population ina period of seven years at an internal medicine departmentand knowing more about this medical approach.Material and Methods: Observational cross-sectional studybetween January 2008 and December 2014 at an internalmedicine department. Oncological patients were included,with recent antineoplastic treatment hospitalized with diagnosis of febrile neutropenia. The clinical and demographicdata were collected based on medical records available onthe clinical process (in paper and in digital format).Results: 156 inpatients were included in a total of 187 hospitalizations by febrile neutropenia. More than 50% was man,with a median age of 67 years old and 63.0% had advancedoncological disease. Fewer was present in 85.6% of admissions and 39.0% had severe neutropenia. Blood cultureswere collected in 77.9% of episodes and 20.0% had bacteraemia. Gram-negative agents were the most frequent andthe antibiotic association had a downward trend, being thecarbapenems the most used.

The PID were quantified and their deprescription was evaluated, during the first year of follow-upby the team.Results: Sixty-eight patients were included, with a mean ageof 77 years. Fifty-seven (83.8%) were medicated with PID.Functional status did not influence the number of PID. Deprescription occurred in 40% of patients. The number of medical visits was the only variable with a statistically significantrelation with the deprescription (p = 0.004).Discussion: There was a high prevalence of PID in this sample, regardless of functional status. The data from this studyare in line with the current scientific literature, which suggeststhat a significant percentage of patients are medicated withdrugs with no proven benefit at this stage.Conclusion: It is essential to review the relevance of all end-of-life patients’ medication, due to the high prevalence of PIDand its consequences.

Score SAPS II and average Charlsonindex of 46 and 7, respectively. Twenty-two patients startednoninvasive mechanical ventilation at the Emergency Department, 6 at the unit and the remaining 6 at the InternalMedicine ward. Main reasons for its introduction: acute cardiogenic lung edema (50%) and acute chronic obstructivepulmonary disease (26%). The rate of therapeutic failure was29%. After 24 hours of noninvasive mechanical ventilation,the differences found between the response and the therapeutic failure group were statistically significant (pH 7.37vs 7.32; p <0.05). Ph variation in the first few hours seemsto be associated with a better ability to predict noninvasivemechanical ventilation response (0.894, p = 0.001).Conclusion: Noninvasive mechanical ventilation reduces patient morbi/mortality through close clinical and arterial gasimetry monitoring. pH variation seems to be the best predictor ofresponse, allowing early recognition of therapeutic failure andfacilitating the use of other therapeutic options in advance.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIn the diagnosis of patients with syncope it is important that theaetiology is correctly determined. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is essential in the evaluation of these patients, combining a meticulous clinical history with an appropriate physicalexamination and auxiliary diagnostic tests. However, even witha correct initial approach, many patients are misdiagnosed orremain undiagnosed, becoming then candidates for a prolonged follow-up. The implantable loop recorder (ILR) is asmall device that allows prolonged monitoring (up to 3 years)of the electric cardiac activity, increasing the likelihood of detecting a correlation between any cardiac rhythm alterationsand the patient’s symptoms. Thus, ILRs have assumed an increasing interest in this area since they allow the detection ofcardiac (arrhythmic) aetiology of much syncope that until thenremained with an unknown cause. The current guidelines recommend the use of ILRs in the early phase of the evaluation ofpatients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause, after initialevaluation, in the absence of high risk criteria and in the evaluation of high risk patients with syncope after initial negativeevaluation. This article is a systematic review that summarizesthe current knowledge about the utility and accuracy of ILR inthe diagnosis of syncope of unknown cause after a conventional diagnostic approach; as well as its utility in many specific situations (epilepsy, paediatrics, elderly, atrial fibrillation andcryptogenic stroke).",

            "resumo": "AbstractHeart failure (HF) is an epidemic syndrome of the 21st century, most often recognized in the elderly. The natural historyof chronic HF is characterized by its considerable symptomatic burden and recurrent acute decompensation leadingto repeated hospitalizations. Thus, HF is the main cause ofhospital admission and rehospitalizations, which translatesinto markedly high costs. Accordingly, in order to improveindividual outcomes and maintain the sustainability of thehealthcare system, it is fundamental to adequately treat HFand its common comorbidities. Recently, iron deficiency (ID)has been recognized in over 30% of HF patients, indicatinga more severe symptomatic burden, morbidity and mortalityrates, constituting a novel therapeutic target. Given the relevance of ID in HF, we ought to:1. Briefly discuss the main findings of trials comparingiron to placebo or control, namely the inefficacy of oral iron(IRONOUT HF) contrasting to the benefits of intravenous (IV)iron, which led to significant symptomatic improvement andpotentially reduced hospitalizations due to worsening HF, asdemonstrated in the main ferric carboxymaltose trials (FAIR--HF, CONFIRM-HF, EFFECT-HF);2. Propose a comprehensive rational algorithmic approachto ID in adequately selected HF patients;3. Emphasize the selection of candidates for IV iron basedon left ventricular ejection fraction, symptoms and haemoglobin concentration; and4. Review the main adverse effects of IV iron and currentgaps in knowledge. An algorithmic approach to ID in HF asan evidence-based intervention may result in optimal therapyfor selected patients, as well as decreased IV iron in inadequate scenarios",

The problemis that fluid responsiveness is not the same as fluid benefit.And we have been wasting time researching in ways to predict fluid responsiveness. I really do not want to know if thepatient is fluid responsive or not (are not we all?), but ratherif fluid expansion is beneficial or detrimental to that specificpatient, on that specific moment. We test patients in shock forfluid responsiveness. If, whatever the method we use, we findthem to be responsive, we do intravenous fluids. We only stopfluid loading/fluid expansion if one of two things happen: if thepatient is no longer in shock, or if the patient is no longer fluid responsive. We would never use a drug with proven harm,especially if its benefit was insufficiently proven. Neverthelesswe continue to use fluids in scenarios in which their harm isproven, but their benefit is not. We need a paradigm shift. Weneed to stop looking for ways to predict fluid responsiveness.We must search for ways to identify which patients benefitfrom fluid expansion, fluid depletion or a neutral fluid strategy. New trials should prospectively compare well defined fluidstrategies (expansion, depletion or neutral) to be applied depending on a set of predetermined tests. Until then, we willend up with the same question: will this specific patient, at thisspecific moment, benefit from fluid expansion, fluid depletionor a neutral fluid strategy?",

Results of approval studies sustainit as safe and well tolerated. However, more recent studieshave raised doubts on its safety profile, for instance at theneuropsychiatric effects developing level.Our aim was to determine prevalence of neuropsychiatric effects or no neuropsychiatric effects on a HIV infected patientpopulation with dolutegravir on their antiretroviral therapy.Material and Methods: Transversal observational study of thecohort of patients followed at Oporto’s Hospital Immunodeficiency Department, subjected to dolutegravir therapy. After the introduction of dolutegravir, clinical files have beenbrowsed and questionnaires have been placed for evaluation of adverse effects.Results: Seventy patients have been identified as under dolutegravir therapy, of which 7 have been excluded for lackof data. Five patients were naive as to antiretroviral therapy.Prevalence rate for neuropsychiatric effects and other effects15 PUBLICAÇÃO TRIMESTRALVOL.26 | N.º 1 | JAN/MAR 2019ARTIGOS ORIGINAISwas 20.6% and 25.4%, respectively. The main neuropsychiatric effects were insomnia, nervousness/anxiety and depressive humor, more frequently observed on female patients[(34.6% vs 10.8% of the men); OR 4.37; CI 95% 1.17-16.27;p = 0.028]. Despite the results, therapy has not been discontinued.Conclusion: Observation of a high rate of neuropsychiatric effects (20.6%), similar to a recently published study. However,these neuropsychiatric effects did not lead to the discontinuation of dolutegravir therapy on any patient. In spite of the limited resources at their disposal for this study, the authorsstrongly stress the need for further studies and evaluations ofthe real impact of neuropsychiatric effects somehow associated to dolutegravir",

Mostauthors define this nephropathy as a form of acute kidney injury in the setting of an international normalized ratio (INR) ≥3 (concerning warfarin therapy) and in the absence of otheretiologies of acute kidney injury. Chronic kidney disease, despite not essential to the development of ARN, is one of itsstrongest risk factors. A kidney biopsy with glomerular hemorrhage, tubular obstruction with red blood cell casts and tubular epithelial cell lesion establishes the definitive diagnosisin the appropriate clinical setting. Treatment is essentially supportive, aiming the correction of excessive anticoagulation.However, renal function recovery is frequently incomplete. Recent studies emphasize new pathophysiological mechanisms,other than those related to glomerular hemorrhage. Direct oralanticoagulants have also recently been linked to ARN. Herein,the authors review the literature about ARN and underline theimportance of this increasingly recognized but probably stillunderdiagnosed entity, so as to improve close monitoring ofchronic kidney disease patients treated with oral anticoagulants.",

Its prevalence in Portugal is unknown.Material and Methods:A cross sectional study was carried out in the region of Grande Porto, Portugal. The non-random sample was composed of 663 subjects, of both genders, varying from 15 to 64 years old. The association between RP’s prevalence and age, gender, marital status, county of residence, profession, occupational exposure to chemical products, vibratory tools and refrigeration systems was investigated. Participants were classified as having RP based on UK Scleroderma Study Group criteria (“A” criteria) and Maricq’s scale of distal finger color (“A+B” criteria). Data were analyzed using the chi-square and McNemar tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.Results:Applying “A” criteria, the prevalence of RP was 4.5% (5.6% in women versus 2.3% in men) and with “A+B” criteria the prevalence of RP was 1.7% (2.0% in women versus 0.9% in men). Only occupational exposure to chemical products was significantly and positively associated with RP. Pallor fingers were the most reliable symptom of RP, regardless the criteria used.Conclusion:Depending on the criteria, the prevalence of RP in Grande Porto varied between 1.7% and 4.5%, and these findings were similar to those found in some other countries. In contrast with other studies, age, gender, occupational exposure to vibratory tools and refrigeration systems had no association to RP",

The purpose of this paper is to assess the evolution of the admissions to the Internal Medicine wards of a referral hospital over 20 years.Material and Methods: Using the Homogeneous Diagnosis Groups database, the admissions to the Internal Medicine wards of a referral hospital were evaluated for age, sex, mortality rate, length of hospital stay, type of admission (urgent or scheduled), main and secondary diagnosis. They were assessed in two 3-year periods with a 20-year hiatus (1/1/1992-31/12/1994: 10 817 episodes and 1/1/2012-31/12/2014: 17 535 episodes). In a subsequent analysis the episodes with a main diagnosis belonging to the V code category were excluded.Results: There was an increase in the age of patients (median: 61 to 79 years-old, age over 65: 36.9% to 80.3% and over 85: 3% to 26.3%), a growing number of females (47.4% to 5.1.8%), a decrease in the length of hospital stay (16.8 to 10.3 days), a rise in the mortality rate (8.3% to 15.4%) and in the number of secondary diagnosis (episodes with more than 6 diagnosis from 17.5% to 64.8%). The increase in the prevalence of respiratory diseases (11.1% to 63.1%), infectious diseases (6.7% to 10.3%) and urinary diseases (3.9% to 11.3%) also stood out.Discussion: We reason that the ageing population, the reorganization of hospital departments and the pressure of the emergency department over the wards is stirring a change causing functional limitations and restrictions to medical education.",

Decades later, the extent and nature of this association are still not completely understood. The aim of this study was to review all Streptococcus bovis bacteremic episodes documented at a tertiary-care centre.Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia admitted to a portuguese centre from January 2000 to December 2016.Results: There were 46 patients with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia within this period. Nearly one third presented endocarditis. Colonoscopic examination was performed in 56.6% of patients, of whom 61.5% had colorectal neoplasm. Streptococcus bovis molecular identification was held in 27 of the isolates: 19 Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 7 Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus and one Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. infantarius. In Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infection cases, endocarditis was the main source of infection (42.1%). Most of these patients developed colorectal neoplasm (83.3%). Conversely, bacteremia cases due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus were more likely to have a hepatobiliary source (57.1%) and only 20.0% developed colorectal neoplasm (p < 0.05).Discussion: Though the clinical relationship between Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and underlying GI diseases has been well-known for years, to date there has been no satisfactory explanation regarding the pathophysiologic mechanism for this association. Subjects infected with Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus tended to present with endocarditis and to have colorectal neoplasm.Conclusion: Further research is required to determine the pathogenic mechanisms in which different subspecies of Streptococcus bovis may be implicated in the development of CRN.",

The internist should be able to ensure comfort care at the end of life of the patients he is attending. The study objective was to analyze the therapy performed and complementary diagnostic tests (CDT) requested within 48 hours before death. Methods: Retrospective observational study with 100 consecutive deaths (from patients with “do not resuscitate indication”) occurring in the Internal Medicine Service for a year. Results: The length of stay was 9.4 ± 7.9 days, the age 86.5 ± 9.9 years, with no gender differences. It was found that 71.0% of patients had at least one CDT application. CDTs included blood tests (54.0%), blood cultures (17.0%), radiographs (19.0%), ultrasound scans (8.0%) or computerized axial tomography (2.0%). They were prescribed: nebulizations (76.0%), antibiotic therapy (74.0%, being 44.6% broad spectrum), low molecular weight heparin (71.0%), nonopioid analgesics (53.0%), among others. In 28.0% of cases there was no prescribed analgesia. The opioid prescription rate was 19.0%. Conclusion: There is an urgent need for a paradigm shift in the care of vulnerable patients. Medicine should not always have a healing glow, but it must always take care, respecting the cultural, clinical and ethical values of the doctor-patient relationship. The internist should in end-of-life patients improve their symptomatic control and avoid the use of inappropriate CDTs without any added benefit to the human person.",

Some estimates indicate that the incidence of the APS is around 5 new cases per 100 000 persons per year and the prevalence around 40-50 cases per 100 000 persons. The aPL are positive in approximately 13% of patients with stroke, 11% with myocardial infarction, 9.5% of patients with deep vein thrombosis and 6% of patients with pregnancy morbidity. Currently, there is consensus in treating APS patients with thrombosis with long-term oral anticoagulation and to prevent obstetric manifestations with the use of aspirin and heparin. This review summarizes the main knowledge on the clinical and therapeutic aspects of this syndrome.",

After the initial usage, in the beginning of the 80’s for the evaluation of abdominal trauma, the POCUS became a daily practice in the critical patient evaluation, either in Critical Care Units or in Emergency Departments, assuming, nowadays, an important role of a large variety of clinical protocols. In this review, the authors propose to revise the established applications of POCUS and point out its practical consequences in medical daily routines as well as reaffirm the importance that it can and must have in pre- and post-graduated medical education.

In this context and assuming that communication is the basis of the good clinical relation it is urgent to clarify concepts and proper words for current practice to spare misunderstandings and wrong decisions. Authors have assumed the need of profound debate on proper words and correct concepts in clinical practice and current communication in Portuguese, so this text pretends to contribute to that clarification.",

Intravenous thrombolysis withrecombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV-rtPA) represents an advance in the treatment of ischemic stroke andits use in the elderly > 80 years old was a recent target ofdiscussion.Material and Methods:A retrospective study was performed in the 2010-2015 period that included patients >80years old with ischemic stroke who underwent IV-rtPA. Thestudy evaluated demographic and clinical variables, occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation and prognosis.Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software.Results:We included 45 patients, mean age 84.4 yearsold and female predominance (62.2%). The main risk factors were arterial hypertension (68.9%) and cardioembolism (62.2%). In most cases, IV-rtPA was performed until3 hours (82.2%). hemorrhagic transformation occurredin 22.2%, with worse prognosis at 3 months (p = 0.000).Lower severity of stroke and length of hospital stay wereassociated with better prognosis at 3 months (p = 0.025and p = 0.005, respectively).Discussion:Some of these results are in agreement withdata from other studies. The increase in age is associated with a worse prognosis. hemorrhagic transformationis one of IV-rtPA concerns. The incidence of arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation increases with age, bothassociated with an increased risk of stroke.Conclusion:The safety of IV-rtPA has been demonstratedin several studies. Age should not be an exclusion criterion, since properly selected patients may benefit fromsuch therapy.",

This study aimed to characterize patients with microbiologic isolation of ESBL-producing strains in a tertiary hospital.Material and Methods: A retrospective study was carried out from the 1st of January to the 30th of June 2014 and included all cases of ESBL producing bacteria isolation in hospitalized adults, in all departments of the Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto. Risk factors, clinical characteristics and treatment options were evaluated.Results: A total of 132 isolates of ESBL producing strains were included. Most patients with ESBL-producing bacteria had an invasive device (58.3%, n = 77). Isolation of the ESBL-producing bacteria occurred, on average, at the 21st day of hospitalization. Part of the patients (19.7%, n = 26) had previous history of ESBL producing strain isolation and 65.2% (n = 86) had been or were under antibiotics at the time of isolation. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated agent (71.2%, n = 94) and uroculture was the microbiological product with the highest isolation rate (62.1%, n = 82). The mortality rate was 6.8% (n = 9).Conclusion: The analysis of these data underlines the importance of identifying colonized patients with ESBL-producing strains and the impact of inadequate antibiotic therapy in the dissemination and persistence of these agents",

Our objective was to analyze the profile of stroke patients to whom In-Hospital Palliative Care and Support Team evaluation was requested.Methods: Retrospective observational study with a sample composed of all patients admitted with primary diagnosis of stroke in a tertiary hospital, with Team evaluation request, over a period of 5 years (2012-2016).Results: A total of 48 patients were evaluated, with a mean age of 79.6 years (± 13.1), 24 female. There were 41 ischemic strokes, with mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) upon admission of 18.1 (± 6.5), and 7 cerebral hemorrhages. Evaluation requests were aimed at care organization (89.6%) and decision-making (70.8%), and for symptomatic control: respiratory (58.3%), gastrointestinal (31.3%) and uncontrolled pain (25.0%). At the time of the first evaluation, the mean Palliative Performance Scale 12.2 (± 8,1). Dyspnea (52.6%) and bronchorrhea (50.0%) were the most prevalent symptoms and aspiration pneumonitis themost common complication (67.4%). Opioid treatment was started in 45.7% and antimuscarinic in 34.8%. In-hospital mortality was 72.9% (n = 35), with 71.4% of deaths occurring on the first 30 days post-event.Discussion and Conclusion: Due to the complexity and prevalence of uncontrolled symptoms in this type of patients, it is clear that acute neurological events often result in severe functional impairment, reducing both quality of life and life expectancy. These are, therefore, unequivocally patients in need of swift access to Palliative Care.",

For patients transported to HDFF, the presumptive diagnosis made by the pre-hospital emergency teamwas analyzed. We also looked at the relationship betweentransportation with a doctor and the priority given in triage bythe Manchester triage system. In addition, we assessed thedestination of the patient following medical examination, themain characteristics of cardio-respiratory arrests and the activation of stroke and myocardial infarction code performedby the team.Conclusion: There are various conclusions to be taken fromthis detailed analysis. Perhaps the most relevant is the invaluable role of the team in diminishing the morbimortalityof patients with suspected myocardial infarction and stroke,when these codes were activated.",

This study evaluated the impact of these drugs on patients’ lives and analyzed the factors responsible for a better response to treatment.Material and Methods: Retrospective study of 80 patients diagnosed with RA and treated with biological drugs between January 2004 and April 2015 in Hospital Senhora de Oliveira, Guimarães (Portugal). Patients were retrospectively evaluated before and 6 months after biological treatment.Results: A total of 80 patients with RA were analyzed, 62 women (77.5%) and 18 men (22.5%), with a mean age of 45.5 (± 13.0) years. About 67.1% of the patients were positive for rheumatoid factor and 55.4% were positive for anti-citrulline antibodies. There was an association between the positivity of these antibodies and RA diagnosis (p ≤ 0.001). Etanercept was the biological drug used in most patients (75.9%). Fifteen (18.8%) patients discontinued the biological drug and 19 (24.1%) switched to another. In 6 months of biological treatment, patients had a significant reduction in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, in C-reactive protein levels and in Disease Activity Score (DAS28), which decreased from 4.91 ± 1.31 to 2.53 ± 1.10 (p ≤ 0.001).Discussion: The results confirm the many benefits of biological drugs in patients with RA.Conclusion: Biological drugs significantly reduce the level of disease activity, inflammatory parameters and symptoms of patients with RA.",

            "resumo": "AbstractThe incidence of stroke in young adults has been increasing in recent decades, resulting in more and more hospitalizations. Likewise, the weight of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, obesity and sedentary lifestyle seems to be increasing, in detriment of other rarer risk factors, classically associated with stroke in this age group. The list of possible etiologies is extensive and the identification of risk factors does not lead to a complete etiological understanding of stroke. Therefore, the approach to this pathology requires not only the adequate use of complementary diagnostic tests but also hierarchical thinking. In this article, the authors present a review of the risk factors and etiologies of stroke in the young adult, focusing on some clinical and diagnostic aspects that are useful for the etiological investigation of these patients in clinical practice.",

There are five major drug-induced hyperthermic syndromes: (1) malignant neuroleptic syndrome, (2) serotonergic syndrome, (3) anticholinergic syndrome, (4) sympathomimetic syndrome and (5) malignant hyperthermia syndrome. The authors aim to review these hyperthermic drug-induced syndromes, their differential diagnosis, possible treatments, as well as the deleterious effects of sustained hyperthermia, evidencing their neurological consequences.

The following clinical characteristics were assessed: age, gender, community versus hospital acquiredinfection, previous antibiotic therapy, proton-pump inhibitors use, severity criteria (namely, > 65 years, leukocytes >20 000/uL and creatinine > 1.5 above baseline), antibioticsused, duration of antibiotic therapy, hospital length-of- stayand mortality.Results: Overall severity was higher in primary-infections(leukocytes > 20 000/uL 21.3% vs 12.0%, creatinine> 1.5from baseline 38.3% vs 20.8%), as were patient’s mortalityrates (23.4% vs 4.0%). Although vancomycin is recommended – in monotherapy or in association with metronidazole – insevere disease, our study showed that in patients with primary-infection plus 2 or 3 severity criteria, metronidazole alonewas the most frequent choice (46.2% if 2 criteria present and57.1% if 3 criteria present). In recurrent infections vancomycin was the initial choice even in less severe cases (100.0%if no criteria and 68.8% if 1 criteria present). Proton-pumpinhibitors use was higher in relapses (84.0% vs 65.2%).Conclusion: This study suggests that primary-infectionscomprise greater clinical severity and mortality; emphasizesthe importance of a severity scoring system to assure appropriate antibiotic regimens and supports the idea that proton-pump inhibitors might be a risk factor.",

Demographic variables, presentation symptoms, risk factors, site of infection, etiology and managementwere accessed.Results: Thirty three cases of spondylodiscitis (19 men, meanage 77 ± 15.5 years) were identified, performing a prevalenceof 0.3%. The more frequent symptoms at presentation wereflank pain, fever and neurological disorders. Twelve patientshad concomitant infection, eight diabetes mellitus and fourcancer. Four patients undergone surgery < 6 months, threehad chronic hepatic disease and one was an intravenousdrug consumer. Twenty-five patients had elevated leukocytecount and/or RCP. Twenty-one patients underwent magneticresonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT)scan, six only MRI, four only CT scan and one only positronemission tomography. Fifteen patients underwent biopsy.The most frequent location was the lumbar spine at L4-S1. In11 patients blood cultures were positive for Escherichia coliESBL, Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant (MRSA) ormethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and inone biopsy identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The antibiotic scheme was vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for patientswith MRSA and negative cultures, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin for patients with E. coli ESBL,flucloxacillin for patients with MSSA. The average duration oftreatment was 5 weeks.Conclusion: Patients with spondylodiscitis are older patientswith co-morbidities. Imagiologic studies are essential for diagnosis as symptoms and laboratory changes may be absent.",

            "resumo": "AbstractBackground: Hemolytic anemia represents 5% of all anemiasand is characterized by a reduction in the survival time ofRed Blood Cells (RBC). The destruction of RBC may resultfrom intravascular or extravascular hemolytic phenomena.The last one is most often associated with autoimmune phenomena, chemical/drug toxicity, infections, hypersplenismand mechanical destruction.The objective of the study was to describe the demographiccharacteristics, main causes and clinical characteristics ofpatients with extrinsic hemolytic anemia.Methods: A retrospective study between January 2010 andDecember 2014 of patients with HA who were hospitalized inan Internal Medicine Service of a Central Hospital. Hemolyticmarkers were evaluated.Results: A total of 22 patients with a mean age of 67.6 (±17.9 years) were included; 54,5% were male. About 81.8%had a positive direct antiglobulin test and the rest a negativeone. Between patients with auto-immune hemolytic anemia,61.1% were associated with infections. At the time of diagnosis, the average value of Hb was 7.5 g/dL, requiring onaverage, 9.8 days reaching values above 9 g/dL. For thetreatment, 36.4% of patients did corticotherapy, 22.7% corticotherapy in association with transfusion of red blood cellsand 13.6% only transfusion, beyond the treatment of the underlying cause. The mortality rate was 9%.Conclusion: Hemolytic anemia. can result from many causesand the majority result from infectious processes. The identification of the underlying cause of hemolysis is extremely important for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach. There isa low mortality rate and the prognosis depends on the underlying cause but the risk increases in elderly patients.",

Recently published statistical data shows that thepopulation aged 100 years or over has shown a strong increase in Portugal. However, there are few studies characterizing such an elderly population which almost invariably isadmitted to hospital at some point.Methods: A retrospective study of patients aged 100 years orover hospitalized in the department of Internal Medicine from01/01/2006 to 31/12/2016.Results: In the period under analysis, there were 172 admissions (< 0.4% of the total) corresponding to 130 patients. Theaverage age was 101.1 years, with 74.4% of the patients being female. A percentage of 51.7% of the patients came fromtheir domiciles, and the degree of dependence for daily lifeactivities evaluated as being “totally dependent” in 60.5% ofcases. Analysis of the personal histories revealed that 46.7%of patients had 2 or 3 comorbidities, with arterial hypertension, heart failure and dementia being the most prevalent.Polypharmacy was present in 41.8% of patients. Infectiouspathology of the respiratory system stood out as the reasonfor hospitalization (57.6%) and as the direct cause of death(52.1%). A mortality rate of 41.3% was found.Conclusion: Hospital admissions for centenarian patientshave been steadily increasing over the years, and these aregenerally associated with a worsening degree of functional dependency and, consequently, higher socioeconomiccosts. This study made it possible to better characterize thispopulation in order to adopt more appropriate responses tothese hospitalizations.",

We describe a Waldenström macroglobulinemia patient presenting with diarrhea, dyspepsia, weight loss and malabsorption. Endoscopic studies revealed diffuse deposition of immunoglobulin M and kappa light chains in the mucosa of the small intestine. Later, on evaluation in the Haemato-Oncology clinic, the risk of death at 5 years was considered low, and thus no further therapeutic measures were proposed. The patient remained stable for three years, when she developed septic shock with rapidly progressive multiple organ failure and died a few hours after admission to hospital. The authors describe the case and elaborate a review of the literature on this pathology. We draw attention to this rare manifestation of an uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder to be considered in the differential diagnosis in a patient with a malabsorption syndrome.",

Forty-four patients had pathologies thatare considered indications, with established evidence of theneed of NIV: 33 (75.0%) had heart failure, five (11.4%) acuteexacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, four(9.1%) obesity hypoventilation syndrome and two (4.5%) severe immunocompromised pneumonia. The failure rate was20.5%. In the remaining 10 patients, NIV was used in severeimmunocompetent pneumonia, septic shock and benzodiazepine intoxication, with a failure rate of 70.0%. There wasa statistically significant improvement in gasometer parameters two hours after NIV in patients demonstrating clear evidence for the need of NIV and in patients in whom there wasno failure of this ventilatory modality.Conclusion: In our sample the failure rate of NIV was significantly lower in patients who complied with the formal indications for the initiation of this type of ventilation. Thus, despitethe increasing use of NIV, careful patient selection is an essential step in its success. The best predictor of NIV successwas good response after 1 to 2 hours of therapy",

In the latter, neutropenia was theprevailing cytopenia (63.6%), followed by anemia (45.5%)and thrombocytopenia (36.4%). The most common symptoms were fatigue and recurrent bacterial infections; 35.7%presented with asymptomatic cytopenias. From patients withCD4+ LGL leukemia, one had colorectal cancer. Prevalenceof autoimmune diseases was 35.7%; its diagnosis precededthe identification of LGL leukemia in all patients. Five patientsrequired treatment; methotrexate was the most selected firstline immunosuppressant. Complete hematological responsewas achieved in two cases. Mortality rate was 14.3% at amedian follow-up time of 2 years.Discussion and Conclusion: Clinical presentation and frequency of cytopenias were close to described in previousstudies. The recurrent association with autoimmunity suggests the existence of common etiopathogenic features;chronic autoantigen stimulation might play a role in the onsetof the clonal disease. Further studies are needed for determining the gold-standard approach of LGL leukemia.",

The objective of this studywas to evaluate vitamin D status in patients with RA and toassess the relationship between vitamin D levels and pain.Methods: In a cohort of 45 patients with RA, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] levels, parathyroid hormone, C-reactiveprotein (CRP) and albumin levels were measured. Diseaseactivity was evaluated by calculating the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28).Results: Forty five patients were included in the study. Thirtyone patients were in remission, 11 patients had painful jointsand the median VAS pain score was 30. Out of the 45 patients, 41 had vitamin D levels below 30 ng/mL. Levels of25(OH)D3 were not found to be correlated to the DAS28score (p = 0.59), the VAS pain score (p = 0.55) or CRP (p =0.16). Parathyroid hormone levels were positively correlatedto CRP (p = 0.01).Conclusion: In our study, it appears that vitamin D deficiencyis highly prevalent in patients with RA but it is not linked todisease severity or pain experienced in RA. PTH levels arerelated to CRP and but not to the number of painful jointsor VAS pain score. This relationship may reflect uncontrolleddisease or be a reflection of physiological vitamin deficiency.Vitamin D supplementation may be needed both for the prevention of osteoporosis as well as for better disease controlin patients with RA and low levels of vitamin D and high CRP",

Thisprocess must be part of every patient’s care plan but mostimportantly in patients at the end of life, i.e., the last 12 monthsof life, consisting in a matter of great pertinence in the scopeof Palliative Care. Drugs with a time to benefit that exceedsthe patient’s estimated life expectancy should be discontinued-mostly drugs given as primary prevention, like statins. Themaintenance of other pharmacological groups can be indicated, provided that the goals of care adjustment is guaranteed(e.g.: antimicrobials, anticoagulants, proton pump inhibitorsand hypoglycemic agents). The deprescribing act intends toavoid or reduce polypharmacy, thus minimizing potential iatrogenic events and the therapeutic burden which takes specialrelevance at the end of life.",

The use of non-invasive diagnosticmethods, including hepatic elastography, have been underinvestigation.Aim: Evaluate the usefulness of transient hepatic elastographyas a non-invasive test for the prediction of presenceof EV, to avoid systematic screening with esophagogastroduodenoscopyin a selected group of patients.Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the patientsof our Hepatology Unit with a hepatic elastography value >13kPa who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy within18 months of its evaluation.Results: We included 259 patients (80.7% males), with amedium age of 57.9 ± 9.8 years; 65.3% had EV (52.1%grade II-III). We built ROC curves correlating hepatic elastographyvalue and presence of EV, and obtained an areaunder the curve (AUC) for presence of EV of 0.755 (cut-off>26.6 kPa, sensitivity 81.1%, specificity 64.4%) and AUCof 0.68 (cut-off > 28,1 kPa, sensitivity 82.9%, specificity49.7%) for grade II-III EV. For viral cirrhosis we obtainedAUC of 0.83 for presence of EV (cut-off > 19.8 kPa, sensitivity95.4%, specificity 62.2%) and AUC of 0.69 for gradeII-III EV (cut-off > 19.8 kPa, sensitivity 94.7%, specificity42.0%). In patients without splenomegaly or thrombocytopenia,AUC was 0.89 (cut-off > 26.6 kPa, sensitivity 86.3%,specificity 81.8%) for presence of EV and 0.75 (cut-off >26. 6kPa, sensitivity 90.9%, specificity 60.6%) for grade IIIII EV.Conclusion: Hepatic elastography values and presence ofEV were related, with a higher significance in the groups ofviral cirrhosis and those without splenomegaly or thrombocytopenia. Cut-off points had high sensitivity, illustrating thepotential utility of transient hepatic elastography in identifyingpatients who may not need to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy.",

Raynaud’sphenomenon assumes its major importance in the spectrumof systemic sclerosis diseases showing the early involvementand the vascular changes in the microcirculationbefore the onset of other clinical symptoms or organinvolvement, and creating an opportunity to prevent vascularcomplications.Methods: We analyzed, retrospectively, clinical data andresults of nailfold capillaroscopy from 110 patients followedup at an autoimmune disease consultation, mainly female.Results: The main reason for performing Nailfold capillaroscopywas the study of Raynaud’s phenomenon,mainly secondary cases (67.4%), being the most frequentunderlying pathology the systemic sclerosis. Significantchanges were not found in the capillaries architecture in27.3% (n = 30). In the remaining, we found minor changesin 28 cases, presence of megacapillaries in 41 patients(37.3%), avascular areas in 35 (37.8%), microhemorrhagesin 36 patients (32.7%) and signs of neoangiogenesis in five(4.5%).

Themean length of hospital stay was 8.7 days and most patientscame from the emergency department. The pluripathology,the polypharmacy and the increasing complexity of the admittedpatients were highlighted. The most common diagnosiswas community-acquired pneumonia. There were littleintercurrence during hospitalization and in 22 cases (7.8%)there was a need to return to the hospital. The majority ofpatients were referred to outpatient hospital after discharge,and the clinical stability prevailed at 30 days post-discharge.Conclusion: This model of hospital admission has demonstratedthe potential to embrace more and more patients,and the experience of the first Portuguese unit will certainlycontribute to the expansion to other hospitals in the country.",

We will not refer any scientific domainbecause, in this case, the same rational could be applied to different scientific and professional fields, from Law to Engineeringor Economy, from Medicine to Social Sciences.Based on the claim that the main outcome of a PhD process is the PhD degree holder, not the thesis, we present the project of NOVA (Universidade Nova de Lisboa) Doctoral School as a complementary training project in a wide range of transversal professional and personal competences offered to the PhD students of NOVA’s nine Academic Units (Schools and Institutes).",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: In Portugal, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects around 14.2% of those older than 40 years. Internal Medicine plays a role in the hospitalized CODP exacerbation patient care. Our objective was to characterize the COPD exacerbation patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward focusing on adverse outcome predictors.Methods: An observational retrospective study retrieved data from three consecutive years. A univariate and multivariate analysis was performed assuming the all-cause in-hospital death outcome.Results: The sample comprised 280 cases. The mean age was 76.0 years and 53.6% were male. At admission, depressed mental status was evident in 21.8% and hypotension in 3.6%. Thirty six percent were acidemic and 64.3% were hypercapnic. A hemoglobin value below 10.0 g/dL was found in 4.6%, eosinopenia in 20.4%, and creatininemia above 2.0 mg/dL in 6.0%. Ten percent had atrial fibrillation. Twenty-nine patients died in the hospital (10.4%). We identified the following predictors: admission in the previous90 days (OR 4.7; p = 0.006), atrial fibrillation (OR 5.0; p = 0.002), systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg (OR 3.7; p = 0.023), eosinopenia (OR 2.7; p = 0.034) and hemoglobin < 10 g/dL (OR 5.1; p = 0.026) and creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL (OR 3.8; p = 0.048). Absence of predictors at admission was linked to a low risk profile.Conclusion: Compared to the overall COPD exacerbation patient, those admitted to an Internal Medicine tend to be older and to have higher degree of comorbidity. The identified predictors can be linked to the COPD exacerbation pathophysiology.",

High level of clinical suspicion and appropriate laboratorytesting interpretation are essential for the diagnosis.The aim of this study was to review the admissions attributableto brucellosis in a public hospital of an endemic region of Portugal.Methods: Retrospective observational study of consecutivehospital admissions with a discharge diagnosis of brucellosisbetween 2000 and 2012, by the analysis of epidemiological,clinical, laboratory and therapeutic features.Results: A total of 36 patients were included. The percentageof male patients was 69.4%, with mean age of 52.9 years oldand 72.2% presented a risk factor exposure for brucellosis.We found 14 admissions in 2000 and zero admissions in 2012.The most reported frequent symptoms were fever (72%), myalgia(58.3%) and asthenia (47.2%). The rose bengal test waspositive for the majority of the tested patients (91.7%). On theother hand, only one patient had a positive culture for brucellosis.The disease was essentially acute (75%) and focalized(69%). When focalized, osteoarticular involvement wasthe most frequent presentation (37%). In univariate analysis,patients who relapsed (16.6%) showed no significant associationwith any of the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory ortherapeutic features (p > 0.05). Antibiotic regimen most oftenprescribed was rifampicin plus doxycycline (55.5%).Conclusion: In our study, hospital admissions due to brucellosisdropped dramatically between 2000 and 2012, whichshows an optimistic sign of disease control. Acute and focalizedforms of the disease were the most frequent manifestationsof this zoonosis that is still a challenge for clinicians.",

The importance of recanalizationis controversial but it is related to residual symptoms/ signs. This study aims to calculate the incidence of CVT, to evaluatethe importance of recanalization and to define its predictive factors.Material and Methods: This is a retrospective observational study involving patients with CVT diagnosed between 2004 to 2014 in Braga Hospital. Functional assessment was based on the modified Rankin scale. Recanalization was defined as thepresence of venous flow in all vessels, including residual. A descriptive statistical analysis was conducted and used test t Student(t), Mann-Whitney U(U), chi-square(χ2) or Fisher’s exact test a binary logistic regression was used for predictive model. It wasrecognized statistical significance p < 0.05.Results: The incidence of CVT was estimated at 1.82 cases per 100 000 person-years. The recanalization was associated with the functional evaluation at 6 (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.001, φc =0.511) and 12 months (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.001, φc =0.480), inability to six (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.024,φ = 0.305) and 12 months (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.023,φ = 0.305), and the residual symptoms/signals at 3 months (χ2(1) = 23.46, p < 0.001,φ = 0.605). The obtained regression model included the following predictive variables age, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, altered state of consciousness and new residual symptoms/signs. This was statistically significant (χ2(5) = 37.43, p < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of 70.8%. New residual symptoms/signs is the best predictor of no recanalization (OR = 33.33).Discussion and Conclusion: The recanalization has an important role in prognosis; it was possible to predict its occurrence basedon five variables.",

In 2014 there was a rule from the National Directorate of Health addressed to this problem.This study aims to quantify the patients with indication to search for MRSA colonization, examine the criteria, implicationsand possible strategies.Materials and Methods: Prospective data about patients admitted to an Internal Medicine Department in five non-consecutiveweeks.Results: The sample includes 224 patients, mostly female, with a mean age of 76 years old. The majority (60.3%) presented indication for screening, which was conducted in 39.3% of the patients; 28.3% were positive. The most common criteria presented were prior antibiotic therapy (37.1%), recent hospitalization (32.1%) and transfer from a hospitalinstitution (16.1%).Discussion: The age factor seems to influence the probability of indication for screening. Most patients showed indication to search for MRSA colonization (60.3%), which means a huge need for practices change. The high level of antibiotic therapy assumes great relevance in this sample (37.1%). In most of the patients, the screening was not done and it is necessary to sensitize the medical and nursing team.Conclusion: It is important to require good practices from health professionals for the implementation of new rules and ensure operating conditions in the services in order they can be applied. It is crucial that the strategies are not implementedalone. The patient must fulfill his part by not taking unjustified antibiotics.",

Analytical evaluation presentedan elevation of the inflammatory parameters, renal dysfunction and a slight elevation of serum amylase and lipase, aswell as severe hyperchloremic acidemia. The first diagnosis hypothesis was thought to be acute pancreatitis. However, attending to the differential diagnosis of metabolic acidemia with normal anion gap and due to bicarbonate loss, the hypothesisof acidemia after ileocystoplasty was more consistent. Treatment with endovenous and oral bicarbonate was institutedand clinical and analytical improvement were observed. It is essential to foresee the metabolic complications of this procedureand consider all possible diagnoses in order to diagnose and treat early, preventing associated morbidity.",

In this review we highlight the main symptoms related to each organ failure as well as treatment and acting options. Due tothe overlap of certain symptoms in terminally ill patients, like pain, dyspnea and diarrhea, we also focus on the advantage provided by the opioid class that effectively covers all these symptoms as well as certain considerations that need to be taken into account in their use in specific organ failures.

However, several studiesreported that anemia may limit the determination of HbA1c.Therefore it is important to assess the relationship betweenthe HbA1c value, the hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) andthe mean corpuscular volume (MCV).Material and Methods: Retrospective study, performed in acentral hospital, based on the collection of HbA1c values andhematological parameters, such as [Hb] and MCV in all analysesperformed in the last 10 years (2005-2015).Results: The results showed that when MCV< 80 fL and [Hb]<12 g/dL (women) or [Hb]< 13 g/dL (men), the HbA1c value wassignificantly higher than the value determined when MCV>80fL and [Hb] ≥ 12 g/dL (women) or [Hb]≥13 g/dL (men).Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed that the [Hb]and the MCV may influence the value of HbA1c. In a diabeticpatient, an increased value of HbA1c may not be indicative ofpoor metabolic control but it could be associated with anemia.It is therefore, important to make the determination of HbA1cand correlate the value with the [Hb], the MCV and plasmaglucose.",

            "resumo": "AbstractThe skin, as the largest organ of the human body, can havea key role in the early diagnosis of systemic diseases. Cutaneousmanifestations can be the initial symptom of certainmalignant hematological diseases (Hodgkin lymphoma,chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia).These can be classified as specific when caused by directinvasion of malignant cells in the skin or by loco-regional expansionof the tumoral disease or unspecific when causedby the altered regulation of the immune system typical ofoncologic patients (characterized by absence of neoplasticcells in the skin). The unspecific injuries are more frequent,have polymorphous appearance and may precede, followor have a parallel course with the underlying malignancy. Inthis article, the most frequent cutaneous diseases associatedwith hematological malignancies are reviewed, namelyneutrophilic dermatoses (Sweet syndrome and pyodermagangrenosum), connective tissue diseases (dermatomyositis),pruritus of unknown origin and vesiculobullous disorders(pemphigus vulgaris and paraneoplastic pemphigus).Although less common, other diseases are also associatedwith malignancy such as amyloidosis, reactive erythemas,vascular dermatoses (livedo reticularis, erythromelalgia andvasculitis) and other disorders (acanthosis nigricans, sign ofLeser-Trélat and acquired ichthyosis). The main purpose ofthis review is to highlight the relevance of cutaneous manifestationsthat can be the first symptom of hematological malignanciesand lead to differential diagnosis.",

In 2007, for the first time since its discovery,Zika virus was responsible for infecting about threequarters of the population from a pacific island, where a benignand self-limited clinical course was verified. Six yearslater, an unprecedented epidemic occurred in French Polynesia,between 2013 and 2014. For the first time there weredescriptions of Guillain-Barré syndrome as a complicationassociated with the infection. Zika virus is estimated to havebeen introduced in Brazil at this time. By the end of 2015, a risingnumber of cases of microcephaly and other fetal malformationsreported in this country seem to be possibly relatedto the Zika epidemic, a fact with growing evidence.At the moment, autochthonous transmission is known tooccur in more than seventy countries by way of vectorialtransmission through Aedes mosquitos. Sexual transmissionhas been reported in several countries with importedcases. However, its real impact in the current pandemic isnot known, as it is difficult to determine the transmission incountries where vectorial transmission occurs.Current strategies in prevention of the infection and its disseminationinclude vector control and individual protectivemeasures.",

Methods: A retrospective, observational study of descriptive character that focused on patients treated in the UCAD during its first year of operation (from September 2013 to September 2014). On each inpatient episode was collected information about demography; diagnosis and comorbidities of the trea-ted patients; intra-hospital transfers; reasons for internment; rates of utilization of advanced hemodynamic and ventilatory supports and mortality results, average time of internment and outpatients’ destination of the patients admitted in the Diffe-rentiated Acute Care Unit of Hospital Center of Cova da Beira during the period in study.Results: The patients treated in the Acute Differentiated Care Unit of Hospital Center of Cova da Beira belong to higher age groups with the average age being 73 years. The inpatient average time was only 2 days and the unit´s occupancy rate was around 88%. The main reasons for hospitalization were diseases of the respiratory tract, followed by cardiovascular disease. A substantial number of patients had, as secondary diagnoses, cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the endocri-ne glands, nutrition, metabolism and immune disorders and diseases of the respiratory system. Of the various performed procedures, stands out the use of intravenous antibiotics and oxygen therapy.Conclusions: The creation of this unit has reinforced the growing need to integrate the different levels of care within the hospital structure, allowing to fill some gaps of Hospital Center of Cova da Beira.",

There has been a recent epidemiological shift trans- lated by an increase of prevalence in older patients, without the characteristic risk factors. This audit aims at analysing the characteristics of the patients admitted to the Internal Medi- cine wards due to infective endocarditis in a six year period. Methods: We selected all the cases coded as infective endo- carditis admitted to the Internal Medicine ward in the period from 01/01/2009 to 31/12/2014. Clinical data was obtained from the electronic medical records.Results: We identified 40 cases (in 39 patients-32 men and seven women, medium age 62.3 years), which fulfilled the modified Duke’s criteria. Twenty-eight (70.0%) patients had native-valve endocarditis, five (12.5%) had prosthetic-valve involvement and two (5.0%) had vegetations elsewhere. Blood cultures were positive in 31 (77.5%) patients. Twenty-eight (70.0%) patients had complications, with valvular regurgitation in 15 (53.5%). Surgical intervention was required in 16 (40.0%) patients. Medium-time to diagnosis was 8.1 days. The avera- ge duration of in-hospital stay was 24.37 ± 31.68 days, with an in-hospital mortality of 17.5% (seven patients).Conclusion: Our analysis reflects the reported epidemiologic shift with an increased incidence in older patients with a more severe presentation at admission. There was an increased in- cidence in an older population, which had more co-morbidi- ties and a more serious clinical presentation.",

We describe a case of a 68-year-old male patient, with complaints of gene- ralized muscle rigidity, perioral fasciculations and slowness of writing movements that started a clinical study after the beginning of fainting episodes preceded by chills, nausea and headache. Analytically the presence of hypocalcaemia of 6.2 mg/dL and computed tomography scan showed multi- ple calcifications involving the basal ganglia.",

This method is currently considered safe and hasa growing applicability in ambulatory regime. The objectiveswere to study the safety profile of BHP performed in our hospital,evaluate the specialty of the executor, the main indicationsfor the procedure, the usefulness of the results and its applicabilityas an outpatient procedure.Material and Methods: We reviewed retrospectively all patientsundergoing BHP in our hospital over a period of 9 years.Exclusion criteria: post-mortem liver biopsies. We studied demographic,clinical and pathological data.Results: We included 137 procedures performed in 133 consecutivepatients (age 51.3 ± 17.2 years, 57.1% were male). Themain indication for BHP was the evaluation of hepatic masses,followed by staging and therapeutic decision at hepatitis C infectionand evaluation of elevated transaminases. The primarypurpose of the procedure was the diagnosis. Gastroenterologywas the medical specialty responsible for most procedures(51.8%). The pathologic results were conclusive in 86.1%of biopsies. The rate of complications described was 0.73%(n = 1): it was one pneumothorax and death in a patient of theintensive care unit. In our population, 12.4% of patients weredischarged at the same day. There were no complicationsdescribed in this subgroup.Conclusion: In this study, BHP was a safe technique, with alow rate of serious complications which affirms its applicationin ambulatory regime. Its result was inconclusive in 14%, indicatingthe possibility of optimization in the future.",

Analyzed data includedweight, waist circumference, glycated hemoglobin, creatinine,estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria/creatinineratio. Results: We included 20 patients, age 62.5 years [54.75-68], diabetes for 15 years [10-21.5] polymedicated with difficultglycemic control and good renal function. There was improvementin glycemic control after 3 months of treatment, but thiswas not maintained over time in most patients (median decreaseof, in absolute value, 0.25% in glycated hemoglobin). Therewas a decrease of 2.25 kg in 12 months. The patients showedslight increase of creatinine and decreased glomerular filtrationrate after 12 months, with no statistical significance. The drugproved to be safe and well tolerated.Discussion: There is great variability in the response to thisnew therapeutic tool both in terms of glycemic control andweight, with some patients showing significant benefit, eventhough not statistically significant globally.Conclusion: Liraglutide is a well-tolerated drug and useful inselected patients. In the overall population studied we did notfind significant clinical benefit, but a subgroup of patients obtainedimprovement in glycemic and/or weight control.",

The presence of atleast two of these clinical features justifies testing for GAD antibodies(GADA). In these patients, anti-insulin antibodies (IAA)are rare while GADA are usually present although they maydisappear over time.Materials and methods: A retrospective study of the medicalrecords, collected in the period between January 1st, 2013and December 31st, 2015, in the Diabetes Unit was performed.Results: Fifteen patients with positive antibodies to LADA wereidentified. Eight were male and seven were female. The meanage at diagnosis was 43 years. The average body mass indexwas 23.8 kg/m2. All patients had titles of GADA> 1U/mL (maximum84, 34 U/L). 87% started treatment with insulin after thediagnosis. The average time between diagnosis and insulintreatment was 2 years. In 11 of these patients other autoimmunediseases were diagnosed, the most frequent one wasthyroiditis (seven of 15 patients).Conclusion: LADA occurs in adults with type 2 diabetes phenotype.The diagnosis is vital so that insulin therapy can bestarted early and other autoimmune diseases associated withLADA can be diagnosed.",

We aim to evaluate theperception of anaemia diagnosis in the Portuguese population,as well as evaluate the characteristics and predictorsof anaemia.Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional, epidemiologicalstudy comprising a sample of 7890 adults representativeof the Portuguese population. Participants were inquiredabout their demographic, anthropometric and clinicalcharacteristics, and their perception about the diagnosisof anaemia; serum levels of haemoglobin, ferritin, creatinineand C-reactive protein were measured using point-ofcaredevices. Anaemia was classified according to thecriteria of the World Health Organization.Results: Although the prevalence on anaemia in Portugalis estimated at 20.6%, only 10.2% of participants referredhaving had a diagnosis of anaemia. The perceptionof anaemia was higher within the region of Lisbon andTagus Valley (20.6%). Nutritional deficiency anaemia(57.7%), especially iron deficiency anaemia (52.7%), representedmost known diagnosed cases. Only 52.6% ofparticipants that have had the diagnosis of anaemia reportedbeing treated; among those, iron supplementationwas the most common treatment. At the time of the studyonly 0.8% of participants with “measured” anaemia wason specific treatment. The following predictors of anaemiawere identified: female gender, age ≥ 80 years, vegetariandiet, student as professional situation, treatment withanticoagulants and gastric protectors, renal failure, andiron deficiency.Discussion and Conclusions: Although anaemia affectsapproximately one in five Portuguese residents, the perceptionof the disease is alarmingly low, suggesting ahigh rate of undiagnosed/untreated cases. Strategies toimprove awareness of this condition should be urgently developed, especially in high-risk groups.",

Stroke mimicswere considered whenever clinical and/or radiological data supporteda non-vascular cause of the neurological deficit.Results: From a cohort of 367 patients, with a median age of76 years old, 12% were classified as stroke mimics. The maindiagnoses were: somatoform disorder, peripheral vertigo, metabolicdiseases, syncope, Munchausen syndrome, intracranialtumors, epilepsy and Chiari malformations. Mimics weregenerally younger, more often women, had a lower neurologicdeficit on admission, as well as lower rates of previous knownatrial fibrillation and cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.05). Vascularrisk factors were not a criterion of distinction betweenmimics and stroke.Conclusion: Contrary to what we might expect, there is asubstantial prevalence of stroke mimics within a stroke unit(12%). The nature of these mimics, some of which requireurgent intervention, can be used to better inform emergencyclinicians and plan for alternative interventional pathways.",

The datawas obtained from the ICD data base. Statistical analysis wasperformed with SPSS version 20.0® program. Results: The 234identified patients were aged between 13 and 83 years (mean50.79 years ± 16.99) and 55.98% were male. In 88.90% of thecases, the poisoning was voluntary, with no statistically significantdifference between genders. There was a statisticallysignificant relationship between the female gender and thehistory of poisoning, p = 0.014. The toxic agent was veryheterogeneous, but drugs were the most frequent source ofintoxication (35.04%) and 19.66% of patients used more thanone toxic agent. The length of hospital stay, duration of mechanicalventilation and the APACHE II score showed statisticallysignificant differences when poisoning by pesticides,drugs or alcohol (p < 0.001) were compared.Discussion: The results are consistent with previous datafrom other authors, revealing the gradual reduction of pesticidepoisonings. Overall, mortality was lower than the averageof admissions in the ICD by other causes. When comparedwith other toxics, poisoning by pesticides had the worstprognosis.Conclusion: Accumulated experience in treating these patientsallowed therapeutic optimization and improved the prognosis.Nevertheless, it is still not possible to identify a psychologicalprofile of the patient with increased risk of death from poisoning",

It is a commonand serious problem amongst palliative care hospitalizedpatients. Our aim was to perform a systematic reviewon the recent scientific evidence (between April 2011 andAugust 2015) concerning the treatment of delirium in thispopulation. From the 2539 articles, we include nine. Two ofthem were about non-pharmacological strategies in frail oldpatients. We found only one comparative study that showssimilarity in the efficacy of haloperidol and aripiprazole, althoughmore adverse effects were found in the first one. Aripiprazoleappears to be less effective in hyperactive deliriumtreatment. Melatonin analogues are between the new drugsunder investigation. Guidelines mostly derive from experts orfrom studies that exclude palliative care patients. Prospectivecomparative studies, with a placebo arm, longer follow--up, double blinded and randomized are needed. Concerningpatients with palliative needs that develop delirium it isurgent to evaluate the potential reversibility of the episode,ensuring support to caregivers and adopting pharmacologicalor non-pharmacological measures that benefit the qualityof life and the goals of both patient and family.",

The aim of this study was todetermine the prevalence of chronic kidney disease among diabeticpatients type 2, even showing normal serum creatinine.Material and Methods: A retrospective observational study with aprocess of clinical revision and analytical results was conducted,involving a total of 483 patients who were followed by external medicineconsultation in what concerns diabetes during the year of 2014.Results: Of the total of patients 60% were women, which mean agewas 65 ± 10.6 years. The studied participants revealed that 31.7%,according to MDRD4 equation and 28.0%, according to Crockcoft-Gault equation, suffered from chronic kidney disease (defined asglomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). The distributionamong the different stages was the following by MDRD4 equation:13.9% in stage, 9.1% in stage 3b, 6.8% in stage 4 and 1.9%in stage 5. In what concerns the Crockcoft-Gault equation, we had:11.6%, 7.9%, 4.1% and 1.7% respectively. Only 44.4% and 43.7%of those with GFR < 60 mL/min /1.73 m2, according to the equationsMDRD4 and GCC presented serum creatinine higher than 1.5mg/dL, despite only in 58.0% the chronic kidney disease was recognized.Microalbuminuria was found in 113 patients (23.4%) of which 48(MDRD4) and 40 (CCG) showed GFR < 60 mL/min /1.73 m2.Conclusion: This study revealed that chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosedand that microalbuminuria appears precociously, despitenormal serum creatinine and GFR can be still unchanged. Assessmentof renal function is therefore important, since detecting chronic kidneydisease during its initial stages provides the opportunity for early therapeuticinterventions.",

The cardiovascular risk factors were defined by validatedcriteria. Independent samples t-student and Mann-Whitneytests were used to compare rheumatoid arthritis patients and controls.Related samples t-student and Wilcoxon tests were carried outto compare patients in different disease stages. Furthermore, logisticregression was also performed to determine the main predictors ofpatients’ cardiovascular risk.Results: From 109 patients and 218 healthy subjects (70.6% female;average age: 53 years), HDL, LDL, triglycerides and Framinghamscale at patients’ diagnosis were significantly different from controls(p < 0.01). Currently, diastolic blood pressure and glomerular filtrationrate from patients were different from controls (p < 0.05). Patients hadhigher diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL at diagnosisthan recently (p < 0.05) and lower HDL (p < 0.001). Finally, age, systolicblood pressure, LDL and triglycerides were associated with a highercardiovascular risk (p < 0.05) while female gender, diastolic blood pressureand total cholesterol were associated with lower cardiovascularrisk (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Rheumatoid arthritis patients have a high-risk lipid profileand high blood pressure at diagnosis, which provides an elevated cardiovascularrisk.",

Important features ofdifferentiated care for the stroke patients include a stroke unit,an approach by a multidisciplinary team and a comprehensiveorganization. Window-dependent diagnosis and therapies, suchas intravenous thrombolytic therapy, access to thrombectomy,early mobilization and rehabilitation are also required. The mainobjective was the quality assessment to the different stages ofthe “stroke circuit” of CHTV, over a period of two years after theimplementation of some measures which intended to improveevent-door and door-to-needle times.Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical andALERT® records of patients admitted to the Stroke unit of CHTVthat underwent intravenous thrombolysis. We analyzed the demographics,the various steps that compose the stroke circuit, timeof hospitalization and NIHS score on admission and after intravenoustreatment.Results: In the period proposed, 92 patients undergone thrombolysis,but only 81 patients met the inclusion criteria. The averageage of patients was 71.93 years, with a predominance offemales. Overall, the times symptom-door and symptom-needlehad a normal distribution while maintaining the medium similarprecedent averages. They were not influenced by other times thatcomprise them.Conclusion: A well-structured “stroke circuit” and its implementationit’s essential to improve the functional outcome. There aremany logistical barriers that limit their performance, but to understandwhere you can “save time” is crucial.",

It is thedoctor’s duty to search for effectiveness and efficiency in strict managementof resources while respecting the principle of justice, withoutforgetting that aggressive medical treatment may be inhumane andundermine the dignity, violating the principle of non-maleficence.Conclusion: Most doctors complied with the principles of dignity,autonomy and beneficence. The non-maleficence and justice issuesgenerated controversy, since they are in conflict with the principles ofautonomy and beneficence. Doctors must take their decisions in fullfreedom, respecting the autonomy of the human being and providingbenefit to health. It is also their duty not to cause intentional harm ordamage to the patients, acting responsively with the resources at theirdisposal in order to provide health.",

It was tested at medical centers across severalcountries. This care model lowers costs, reduces complicationsand is highly rated by patients. The program is offered to patientswho require hospital admission for certain diseases, such ascommunity-acquired pneumonia, congestive heart failure,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cellulitis. Patientswho meet specific medical eligibility criteria can receive hospital-level care–including diagnostic tests and treatment therapiesfrom doctors and nurses–in their own home. In Portugal homecare is very poor and hospital wards are often crowded with sickfrail elderlies, who would benefit from better health care in thecomfort of their home.",

Early recognitionand severity stratification; 2. Optimize O2 delivery (DO2) to prevent andsupport organ dysfunction; 3. Focus control with proper antibiotics andsurgery/drainage (when indicated). After 2012 SSC recommendationsseveral papers have been published changing state of the art for clinicalpractice.The initial manifestations depend on the immune status andthe presence of comorbidities. The number of SIRS criteria clinicallyrecognized correlates with prognosis and demand the research forseverity criteria that, when installed, establish urgent intervention procedure.Disoxia manifestations (hyperlactatemia) of hypotension thatdo not respond to proper volume infusion and/or are associated toorgan dysfunction, once again, are the most serious. Fluid’s prescriptionin sepsis should not include starches, gelatins or hyperosmoticfluids. It has been recognized that albumin has no deleterious effectson sepsis but is not recommended for hemodynamic stabilization.Balanced crystalloid are preferred as fluids for resuscitation becauseof the risk hyperchloremicacidosis with 0.9% saline. Presently no fluidis recommended as the ideal one. Ultrasounds, along with the patientitself, have an important role in the differential diagnosis and severitystratification, evaluating treatment response and identifying the causeof sepsis. Severity stratification and treatment monitoring should followthe “2O+2C” strategy, resumed in 4 questions: How is oxygenation?How is circulation? How are organs? How is the cell? Severe sepsis isan emergency requiring immediate treatment.",

The last endemic cases reported in Portugaldate back to 1959 and since then all cases have been imported.Objective: characterize the malaria cases diagnosed in a Portuguese hospital from 2002 to 2013.Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patients positive forPlasmodium.Results: The study sample included 51 patients, 44 of which were male, and with a mean age of 38 years old. The majority of thepatients were of Portuguese nationality and the most common origin of transmission was Africa, followed by Timor and Brazil. Most of the patients were Portuguese professionals working abroad with previous history of malaria that were not on chemoprophylaxis. The most common symptom was fever followed by headache and myalgia, associated with raised inflammatorymarkers, thrombocytopenia and liver dysfunction. Plasmodium falciparum was the most common diagnosed species and 15patients filled the criteria for severe malaria. Most cases required hospital admission and the most frequent treatment consisted ofquinine and doxycycline. Throughout the 12 years there was only 1 case of death which represents an overall mortality rate of 2%.Conclusion: New trends in emigration destinations and longterm travelers to endemic countries will certainly increase thenumber of malaria cases. It is therefore vital direct to our efforts into the improvement of diagnostic methods, treatment andpre-travel advice.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a single-center experience of the safety of TEE in a special population of patients with acute ischemic stroke.Methods: We included 171 adult patients (mean age 62.8 years) who underwent TEE because of the management of acute ischemicstroke. We determined complications of TEE: examination impossible to perform, pulmonary, cardiac and bleeding complications, trauma/ perforation and others (odynophagia, dental injury and death).Results: Of the 171 patients, 2.9% had minor complications: 2 cases of patient refusal, 2 cases of failure to successfully insert theTEE probe and 1 case of odynophagia. Major procedural complications were noted in one case (0.6%): an esophageal perforation.Discussion and Conclusion: In our study, TEE had one major complication, an esophageal perforation, but no deaths occurred.TEE is a safe procedure, even in acute stroke patients.",

The average hospitalstay was about 4 days. Most of the patients came from the emergency department (45.3%), followed by the ward of Internal Medicine (27.1%) and the Intensive Care Unit (20.9%). The main reasonsfor admission were pneumonia (33.5%), which came up with greatexpression, intoxication (8.7%), pulmonary embolism (8.3%) andglobal respiratory failure (7.1%). The mortality rate was 5.7%. Step-up occurred in 7.9% of patients and step-down in 92.1%, withthe vast majority of patients being transferred to the ward of InternalMedicine.

Several diagnostic hypotheses were raised: infectious meningoencephalitis,autoimmune encephalitis, and metabolic encephalopathy. Despite treatment (antibiotics, correction of hyperosmolar stateand anticonvulsant therapy), continuous cognitive deteriorationand seizures persisted. We raised the hypothesis of an autoimmune limbic encephalitis by anti-GAD antibodies and treatedwith human immunoglobulin. There was a dramatic improvement, corroborating the diagnosis (along with imaging findings). Although difficult to diagnose, limbic encephalitis shouldbe considered when studying acute confusional states withpsychiatric symptoms and seizures.

A focus group selected questions for an onlineanonymous questionnaire, determining Interns demographicdata, as well as satisfaction rates in the various learning scenarios, working conditions and dynamics.Results: We collected 213 valid questionnaires (estimated response rate of 28.4%). Average global satisfaction with theinternship was 4.05/6 (±1.14). The most unsatisfied residentswere those with more weekly working hours (p =0.018) hoursin the emergency department (p = 0.010), worst working environment among residents (p <0.001) and higher frequency of taking decisions they felt unprepared to (p <0.001). Astatistical model identified as satisfaction predicting factors(p <0.001): satisfaction with training in the ward, in the emergency department and in the outpatient setting as well assatisfaction with their mentor; accounting for 69.0% of thesatisfaction with the internship (R2=0.69; R2a=0.68).Discussion: The quality of the training in the emergency department, as well as the long hours and the difficult decisionmaking, contribute to lower satisfaction rates. The predictionmodel identified as key aspects of residency satisfaction, thequality in the emergency and outpatient settings, as well thesatisfaction with the mentor.Conclusion: Portuguese Internal Medicine residents are overall satisfied with their training. Training in the ward, emergencyand outpatient settings are key aspects to consider in orderto improving internship.",

Several international studies have demonstrated very high in vitro susceptibility of these bacteria to fosfomycin. Theclinical efficiency of this treatment was tested on acute uncomplicated cystitis due to Escherichia coli subset, with encouraging results.In Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca EPE (HFF) there has beena progressive annual increase in the isolation of these pathogens.The authors’ goal was to test the susceptibility of ESBL-producingEnterobacteriaceae to fosfomycin in HFF and assess its possible therapeutic potential.Material and methods: Prospective study (6 month period), inwhich the susceptibility to fosfomycin of isolated ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was tested. The VITEK 2® equipmentwas used to identify the strains. The fosfomycin susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method (Oxoid®). Statisticalanalysis was performed using the Microsoft Excel® software.Results: We identified 150 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, of which 52 % corresponded to Klebsiella pneumoniae and 44%to Escherichia coli. Approximately 88% of Escherichia coli and68% of Klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible to fosfomycin.Conclusions: Based on the data obtained at international level and in this study, the authors recommend the use of fosfomycinfor the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. Future clinical efficacy researchis needed in order to substantiate this practice and recommendation.",

Severity/complexity of the conditionsthat led to activation of prehospital emergency teams was assessedusing the patient’s final destination at the hospital.Results: We found that in all groups of the International Classification of Diseases there was an overdiagnosis made by the prehospital emergency staff, in which the asthma diagnosis was the one thatpresented the biggest difference when compared to the hospitaldiagnosis. In the case of prehospital diagnosis of stroke we foundthat 30.8% (12/39) of these cases were not in fact primary neurologic disorders but oxygenation and/or hemodynamic problemswith neurologic symptoms. In the circulatory system, 51.7% (15/29)of the diagnostic hypotheses posed as unstable angina were notrelated with the coronary fast-track. The most frequent result ofEmergency Department stays was hospital discharge, in all systems except in the respiratory. Therefore, the majority activationscorrespond to a mild degree of severity/complexity. Death and hospitalization occurred most frequently in cases related to problems/ diagnosis of the respiratory system.Conclusion: There is an excessive tendency to establish specific nosologic diagnosis. Prehospital diagnostic hypothesis should beless nosological and more problem oriented. Problems of nervous system, circulatory and injuries / poisonings are the most prevalent in this region's prehospital activity, but respiratory problems are thesystem with poorest diagnostic performance and dimmest prognosis. Therefore, respiratory problems arise as a priority issue in VMER attention and preparation.",

Pleurodesis is an option to treat these effusions, in order toalleviate symptoms and to improve the quality of life. This technique can also be used to treat benign pathologies.Objectives and Methods: retrospective descriptive study of patients that underwent a pleurodesis between the years 2009 and2013, in an Internal Medicine Service, considering the indication for the procedure, technique, complications, success and follow-up, seeking to compare the results with the available literature.Results: 27 patients underwent pleurodesis during this period of time, mostly from the male sex. The average age was 67.3 yearsand the main subjacent disease was lung adenocarcinoma. Recurrent malignant pleural effusion was the main indication, and theother pleurodesis were motivated by pneumothorax. A chest tube was placed and talc was used in most cases. The technique wassuccessful in 70.4% of the patients. The most frequent complications were pain and fever. 48.1% of the patients were submitted tosome kind of treatment for their disease after the pleurodesis. 30-day mortality after the pleurodesis was 14.8% and 33% of patientswere alive 6 months after the technique.Conclusion: All the pleurodesis were performed according to the established criteria. The success rates, complications and survivalwere consistent with the expected values. This success rate leadsto less hospitalizations and admissions in the Emergency Department and to the improvement of the patients’ quality of life.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a step-by-step approach on the etiologic diagnosis.Methods:Analysis of hospital admissions studying the etiology ofmoderate to large pericardial effusions using a step-by-step approach that included general evaluation (clinical history and physical examination), basic diagnostic tests and pericardiocentesis.Results:The study included 44 patients, 81.8% with large pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis for diagnostic purposes wasperformed in 43.2% cases. The application of the algorithm led to the definition of an etiology in 70.5% patients. The most common causes were: neoplasm (18.2%), tuberculosis (15.9%), mechanical complication of myocardial infarction (13.6%), post-cardiacsurgery (9.1%), collagen vascular disease (4.5%) and heart failure (4.5%). Phase I (clinical evaluation) of the protocol revealed 50.0% of the diagnosis, phase II (diagnostic tests) 15.9% and phase III (pericardiocentesis) 11.4%. On the follow-up, mean of 15.7months, there was recurrence of pericardial effusion in 15.2% patients and the mortality rate was 36.4%, without any alteration tothe initial diagnosis. The prognosis was dependent on the etiology.Conclusions:The use of a step-by-step approach revealed thatthe clinical history is the main tool to reach an etiologic diagnosis of a moderate to large pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis,which was diagnostic in 36.9% of the patients, is more accurate inthe definition of the etiology.",

According to their albuminemia at admission the patients were grouped (group 1:<2.8 g/dL; group 2: 2.8 – 3.5 g/dL; group 3: >3.5 g/dL). Wealso determined the age, dependence in daily activities, lengthof stay and mortality. SPSS® - V19.0 was the statistical program used to make the statistical work of the data collected.Results:We found that 46% of the patients (92) were in group 1. Older and more dependent patients had lower albuminemiavalues (p<0.001). The ANOVA test showed that patients withlower albuminemia had longer length of stay (p=0.02). The Qui-square test for a linear trend identified a significant correlationbetween albuminemia and mortality (p=0.001).Discussion:The results described, being statistically significant, may not imply that albuminemia is directly responsible. Itmay be a marker of other risk factors.Conclusion:Our results show that hypoalbuminemia at admission correlates with longer length of stay and higher mortality",

In 2012 and 2013 new audits were carried out.Results:From 2011 to 2012, a statistically significant improvement in the guidance of patients was identified (57.8% to 70%),however, there was a statistically significant setback from 2012to 2013 (52.5%).Discussion:The contributing factors for the improvement seenfrom the first to the second audit may have been the elaboration of the SU prophylaxis protocol along with staff training.Such improvement was dissipated in the third audit, probablybecause of the controversy that surrounds this subject and theabsence of new training activities.Conclusion:This trial intends to remind that not all hospitalizedpatients have criteria for SU prophylaxis and that is importantto define protocols adapted to the reality of each institution aswell as maintaining permanent staff training.",

Compare to national data. Publish the data asa pocket guide.Results:We studied 4760 microorganisms, 40.5% related to community acquired infections and 59.5% to nosocomial infections. The majority (58.7%) was isolated from urine culture. The most frequentmicroorganisms isolated were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial susceptibilitydecreased considerably when matching community and nosocomial strains, in particular those of Escherichia coli and Klebsiellapneumoniae. When compared at national level, the microorganisms isolated in the LM-HGO generally had a greater percentage ofantimicrobial susceptibility, offset however, by the higher prevalenceof MRSA.Conclusion:Multidrug resistance to antimicrobials is problematic inHGO. In addition to infection control measures, it is essential to optimize the use of antimicrobial agents. The knowledge of the susceptibility profile data of the institution´s microbiological flora contributesto selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial. The elaboration of apocket guide with this information is pioneer in HGO and favors its application in clinical practice.",

Surely this was ahard winter and the work at the Emergency Services is alwaysdifficult and chaotic. However, Internal Medicine doctors shouldwork on the solution for actual problems in the Emergency Services. The organization models currently working at the EmergencyServices have led to the breakup of each hospital into two different ones, one by doctors working on the emergency room andanother by doctors working at the wards. Emergency Servicesteams, initially composed with competent and motivated doctors,have been worn-out by the difficult and exhausting work, leadingmany times to the rupture of their own teams, with the consequentloss of quality on their work. Ward teams are currently confined tonight and weekend shifts and have learned to see the Emergencydepartment has a non pleasant place to work. Resident doctorshave also lost the feeling that the Emergency Services is a placeto learn. Reorganization of hospital teams can lead to a betterperformance of Emergency Services. The implementation of amix model, including doctors of emergency and ward teams, mayhave advantages for both groups of doctors and for residents. Itis necessary to discuss and implement new measures, preparingfor the next winter.",

As such,the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of Delirium are of paramount importance.Objectives:to study the incidence, risk factors and type of Deliriumepisodes amongst Internal Medicine inpatients.Methods:this was a prospective, observational study, which included all patients admitted in an Internal Medicine ward, during atwo month period. The nursing team identified patients with Delirium, using the Confusion Assessment Method. An assessment was made of the risk factors, precipitating factors, type of disorder and need of medication.Results:during the study, 11% of our Internal Medicine inpatientshad at least one episode of Delirium. All of these patients were over65 years old and 75% were male. One third of the patients had 4 or more simultaneous risk factors. 63% of the Delirium episodes were of the hyperactive type and 73% of these needed medication.Conclusion:The incidence of episodes of delirium in our nurserywas 11%. 63% was accompanied by hyperactive disorder. All patients had at least one factor risk which made them more vulnerableto this disease.",

            "resumo": "AbstractThe chaos in the emergency services (ES) occurs anytime thedemand exceeds the implemented capacity, which is neverenough when a hospital receives everyday during the wintermore than double the usual number of patients. As long asthe primary care services continue not to offer reasonablealternatives for the treatment of severe diseases, people willkeep on flowing by the hundreds to the hospital emergencyservices, even if aware of the multiple hours of waiting aheadof them. They do not know whether the grievance they suffer from is something mild or if it is the indicator of a seriousmalady. They come to the emergency services because it isthe only trustworthy door open, and because they fear for theirlives. Another long-standing problem is the rapid exhaustion ofhospitals’ capacity for hospitalisation, in connection to the riseof the needs of the ES. The specialisation of the health careteams is not the solution for the overloaded ES, although ithas been suggested by believers of this system as if it were. InPortugal, as long as the patients arrive by the hundreds at theES without any medical triage whatsoever, and more than 93%of the hospitalisations are conducted through the emergencyservices, it becomes essential that the doctor takes on a holistic approach, guaranteed by the internist. Only then can thequality of assistance and the institutional unity be assured, andthe inadequate discharges avoided. This year, a combinationof factors emerged, which resulted in the terrible outcome wehave witnessed. The vaccine for the influenza was not as effective. The patients were older, they carried more diseases andpresented many more social deficiencies, leading to a substantial increase in the need of hospitalisation. Economic austeritycaused the reduction of the health care staff in terms of doctorsand nurses, and robed them both of any rational motivation. Itwas only natural that a storm would begin to take form out ofthe first winds.",

In Portugal, theyrepresent the second most frequent community acquired infectious disease and the main hospital acquired infection inInternal Medicine wards. A great prevalence of antibiotic resistance may exist against the first line of recommended antibiotics for urinary tract infections. A retrospective analysis fora one year period was performed aiming to characterize thepopulation of patients discharged from an Internal Medicineward diagnosed with urinary tract infections. This populationwas assessed in terms of age, gender, type of urinary tract infection, etiologic agent, resistance profiles, prescribed antibiotics and associated diseases. From the results obtained, theauthors state that 91% of urinary tract infections diagnosescorresponded to acute cystitis. The majority were community acquired (CAUTI) and 31% were hospital acquired (HAUTI). The etiologic agent was identified in 68% of performedurine cultures. 21 different spp were identified in the followingorder of frequency: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. There waslow susceptibility to quinolones (19-20%), ampicillin (12-19%)and first generation cephalosporin (11%). The most frequentlyprescribed antibiotics were amoxicillin clavulanate, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The most prevalent associated diseases were diabetes, dementia and the presenceof a chronic vesicle catheter. This work demonstrates highresistance to quinolones, ampicillin and first generation cephalosporins for CAUTI as for HAUTI this may be caused by theexcessive use of these antibiotics in the last years. Ciprofloxacin was the second most prescribed antibiotic and the secondmost resistant one what reinforces the need of knowledge ofthe local microbial reality to adjust prescribing habits.",

SystemicNocardia infection in a majority of the cases begins as a primaryrespiratory or cutaneous infection that can complicate with disseminated disease involving the central nervous system (CNS).Less than 10% of all cases of Nocardiosis result from primaryCNS infection, and even more unusual is Nocardia infection inimmunocompetent patients.Objective: This article presents a rare case of CNS Nocardiainfection followed by systemic disease in a previously healthy patient.Results: Male patient, an agricultural engineer, admitted to theEmergency Room (ER) with fever, coughing, sputum and shortness of breath. During the previous year, the patient was diagnosed with Nocardia brain abscess. He was treated surgicallywith excision of the lesion, as well as with antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling. During this visit tothe ER, on physical examination, the patient presented difficultybreathing and bilateral rhonchi on lung auscultation. Blood workindicated presences of inflammation; however, chest x-ray didnot show any recent lesions. During his hospital stay, the patient continued to worsen. Bronchoscopy was performed and onbronchoalveolar lavage multi-resistant Nocardia was identified.Though correct measures were applied, the patient presentedwith respiratory exhaustion, eventually necessitating mechanicalventilation. Ultimately, the patient died after 124 days of hospitaladmission.Conclusion: Nocardia, a ubiquitous bacteria, rarely causes infection in healthy individuals. This clinical case illustrates a rareexample of primary CNS Nocardia infection with secondary systemic involvement.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction and objective: Dengue Fever has been historically describedin the literature at least since the 18th century. In the last few years viraltransmission has intensified all over the world with an increasing incidenceon dengue hemorrhagic fever due to a growing urban development, population growth, increased mobility and climatic changes. Aedes aegypti mosquito is the transmission vector. Most dengue infections are subclinical. There are 3 stages of disease: febrile, critical and the recovery phase.The most frequent signs and symptoms are: fever, facial flushing, musculoskeletal pain, retro orbital pain, photophobia and headache. Hemorrhagic diathesis can also happen. Thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and liverimpairment (increase on liver enzymes and delayed INR) are reported inmost cases of dengue. The authors present cases of dengue requiringhospitalization during the first European epidemics of the 21st century. Theaim of this study is to evaluate the demographic features, how the clinical condition has been evolving and manifesting itself, and its laboratory findings.Material and methods: a retrospective study of dengue cases diagnosedfrom the 1st September 2012 to the 31st December 2012 and requiringhospitalization, through the assessment of their clinical files. Results: 67patients were admitted for hospitalization, forty three women and twenty four men. The mean age was 44 years. The symptoms leading most patients to seek medical help were: muscle pain (31 patients / 42.3%),nausea (18 patients / 26.9%), headache (17 patients / 25.4%), abdominal pain (7 patients / 10.4%), exanthema (5 patients / 7.5%), diarrhea (3 patients / 4.5%) and arthralgia (3 patients / 4.5%). Hepatic dysfunctionwas frequent, being present in 88% of the patients. Thrombocytopeniaand leucopenia were present in 86.5% and 80.6% patients. The averagelength of time in hospital was 5 days. All patients received support care.There were no major complications. Conclusion: The characteristics of ourpopulation were similar to the other published series, although in MadeiraIsland only the serotype 1 virus was reported. The inexistence of otherserotypes may explain the fact that there were no secondary infectionsand serious cases (hemorrhagic fever). Supportive care is the main form oftreatment. A new epidemics with a different serotype probably will causesecondary infections, and Madeira Island must be prepared to face themin the best possible way.",

He was diagnosedwith homocystinuria based on severe hyperhomocystinemia and MTHFRgene mutations. Partial clinical and laboratory remission were observedwith folic acid, cobalamin, pyridoxine and restrictive diet.His sister, age 33, with a history of mild cognitive impairment and epilepsywas studied and the same genetic mutations were identified. Her homocysteine levels remained high despite being under the same treatment as her brother, and she developed persecutory paranoid delusions, spasticparaparesis, hyperreflexia and altered proprioceptive sensitivity.In both cases the neuro-axis study showed patterns of diffuse leucoencephalopathy. Only with the introduction of betaine was an adequate metabolic and clinical control achieved. Despite marked reduction of homocysteinemia, the index case died of massive pulmonary thromboembolism.Homocystinuria must be considered in young adults with psychiatric andpyramidal symptoms. Despite being recognized as a hypercoagulabilitysyndrome, there is insufficient clinical evidence to establish therapeuticguidelines with regards to anticoagulation in homocystinuria.",

These may be observed days or months after the acute poisoning. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, on imaging features andneuropsychological tests. It is important to exclude differential diagnoses.The authors describe a case of a 44-year-old man admitted with confusion, altered behavior and psychomotor agitation during 4 days, with no previous trauma or fever. He presented a history of severe CO poisoningthree months prior to admission, without sequelae. On hospital admissionthe patient was disoriented, agitated, with attention deficit and hallucinatory activity. The cerebral CT scan revealed the presence of bilateral nonspecific pallidal hypodensities, suggestive of old lesions, consistent withCO poisoning on brain MRI. Metabolic, endocrine, toxic and infectiouscauses and also vitamin deficiencies were excluded. The neuropsychological screening tests revealed an impairment of higher brain functions, compatible with a Delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome.The authors emphasize the importance of early recognition and treatmentof acute CO poisoning highlighting the need for long term monitoring ofthese patients in order to identify late manifestations as early as possible.",

Indeed, withregard to early diagnosis, the big issue will be the training of professionalsand institutions enabling them to take care of a much larger number ofpersons infected within a relatively short time (it is estimated that in Portugal, there may be over a third of patients with regards to the total number of those who are already known, which means between 10 and 15.000 ofnew people infected with HIV, generally bringing a total of approximately 40to 50.000 carriers throughout the country). With regard to early treatment,however, the questions that arise are much more complex and contentious, standing on three main levels: Its implications in the epidemiological dynamics at the community level (regional and global), and its repercussions in the long term, both in economic and financial fields and in health and, finally, the functional prognosis and life expectancy of each of thecarriers of this infection that start early TARV, possibly after its respectiveserologic confirmation.",

Assessment of the PSI twenty variables andstratification of patients into risk classes I to V was performed.Results: we assessed 582 patients, 55% were male and 45%female, with an average age of 74.1 years old (± 14.9years).Mortality was similar in both genders and increased with age.Mortality was higher in patients coming from nursing homes,but was similar when comparing co-morbidities. The distributionamong risk classes was: class I – 3.5%, class II – 4.2%, classIII – 6.0%, class IV – 28.5% e class V – 57.7%. In our series,mortality was similar to the one predicted by the PSI-20. Initialantibiotic therapy was empirical.Conclusion: The algorithm to identify low-risk patients is applicable to our population. Based on the recommendations forinpatient treatment, most of the patients in risk class I, II and IIIcould have been treated in an outpatient regimen. Mortality washigher among classes IV and V, as in the study by Fine et al. and subsequent validations.",

            "resumo": "AbstractAllergies are a growing problem in modern societies, with about20% of the world population suffering from allergic rhinitis,asthma or atopic eczema. When the patient presents symptomsconsistent with allergy, the physician must evaluate whether thereis an allergic mechanism, choosing the most adequate test forthe situation and which allergens are involved. The diagnosisof IgE-mediated allergic diseases is based upon skin testingand/or specific serum IgE measurement. When skin tests areperformed, it is important to use standardized allergen extracts,using positive and negative controls, having criteria of positivityand always integrate the results in the context of the clinicalhistory. It is therefore important to train investigators/clinicians toperforming such technique, because when correctly carried out,skin prick tests are the preferred method for the confirmation ofallergen sensitivity.",

These concepts have emerged over the past threedecades in an attempt to prevent the institution of therapies thatdo not provide any additional improvement of patient´s life exceptjust prolonging it. Globalization has enabled an associated gradual increase with interactions amongst various religions. Thesereligions share different beliefs and points of views regarding theinvolvement of doctors, patients and the family in ELD and theethics involved when facing death. The clarification of patient´sreligious beliefs can lead to a better communication between thedoctor, the patient and their families and enabling thus a moreconsistent decision making regarding end-of-life care.",

All inpatients have an increasedrisk for VTE and there are several measures that can be used toprevent it. International guidelines recommend their use both insurgical patients as in medical patients. The aim of this studywas to assess compliance with thromboprophylaxis institutionalguidelines.A cross-sectional study was carried out in a Portuguese Hospitalthree years after guidelines were implemented there. For each patient, in the different departments for acute conditions, the authorsstudied the individual risk and the global guideline compliance.Out of 234 inpatients at the hospital, 25 were excluded. Thepatients were divided in two groups according to their conditionbeing primarily a medical or surgical one. In our sample 80.4% ofpatients presented moderate/high risk of VTE. The compliance ratewith institutional guidelines was: 75.3%; and 86.6% (in medicaland surgical patients, respectively); reflecting a better compliancethan reported in previous literature. However in patients at riskfor VTE and heparin use contraindications only 9.7% underwentmechanical prophylaxis. This last issue represents an importantfield for future improvement.Key words: Venous thromboembolism; deep vein thrombosis;pulmonary embolism; low-molecular weight heparin.",

Theobjective of this study is to characterize the population of ourhospital area with a CVT diagnosis. Material and Methods: Weused a non probability convenience sampling of patients admitted from the 1st January 2020 to the 31st December 2010,having in their discharge records a diagnosis of cerebral venousthrombosis. A retrospective, observational and descriptive studywhere the respective clinical files were assessed. Results: Wehave identified 20 patients, all Caucasians, aged between 18 and82 years, with a mean age of 50.4 years, being 80% females.Most had subacute progression (onset of symptoms between 48hours to 30 days prior to diagnosis). Headache was the mostcommon initial symptom (85%), and in 15% of patients it wasthe only symptom. The diagnosis was achieved through cranialCAT Scan in 55% of cases. The superior sagittal sinus, the leftside sinus and right side sinus were the most often affected.Treatment was made with anticoagulants in 75% of cases. Fullrecovery occurred in 85% of patients and 10% patients died. Wefound recurrent thrombotic events in 10% of patients. The mostcommon sequelae were headache (45%). The risk factor mostfrequently found was oral contraceptives (35%). The etiologyremained unknown in 20% of cases. In 5 patients were identifiedmore than one cause for the CVT. Conclusion: In this work theauthors intend to raise the alert to an entity that requires a largeclinical suspicion for the diagnosis.",

Thescreening revealed mild anemia, leukocytosis with neutrophiliaand elevated CRP. She was admitted with a diagnosis of Sweet'ssyndrome to investigate the etiology. A skin biopsy showed adense infiltrate of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils),confirming the diagnosis. Further laboratory tests were carried outincluding myelography. After colonoscopy with biopsy, was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Treatment with prednisolone led toa rapid improvement of symptoms and regression of skin lesions.The Sweet's syndrome, or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis,is a rare entity. The etiology is unknown but probably results froma hypersensitivity reaction, leading to cytokine production withsubsequent activation and infiltration by neutrophils. Crohn'sdisease is one of several systemic diseases that can be the basisof Sweet's syndrome, although associations are rare. The authorsreport another case of this rare association and originality of thecase is still at the age of diagnosis of Crohn's disease.",

The authors present a retrospective study based on thereview of nosocomial pneumonia cases through their clinicalfiles for a period of one year. A total of 168 cases were identified(73.8% Healthcare-Associated Pneumonias – HCAP; 22.6%Hospital Acquired Pneumonias – HAP; and 3.6% Ventilation--Associated Pneumonias). Empirical antibiotics directed againstclassical “community bacteria” were used in 69.6% of the cases;36.7% of these had to be changed later. A pathogen was identifiedin 43.4% of the cases in which an etiological investigation wascarried out. 38.9% of the respiratory secretions cultures werepositive. The most prevalent microorganism was Staphylococcusaureus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accountedfor 13.9% of all nosocomial pneumonias in which an etiologicalinvestigation was carried out. It seems there is a higher risk ofmultidrug-resistant microorganisms in the subgroup of HCAP withan admission less than 90 days before and in the subgroup oflate-onset HAP. The 30 day mortality rate was 46%. This studyhas the limitation of being retrospective. It served as a startingpoint for a prospective investigation that is now being performed.",

The aim of this study has been to evaluate theincidence of paradoxical inflammation phenomena in patients withinflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with infliximab (IFX).Methods: The authors carried out a retrospective analysis of 64patients with IBD (55 with Crohn disease (CD) and 9 with ulcerativecolitis (UC)). They were interviewed and clinical processes reviewed inorder to identify possible adverse effects associated with this therapy.Interim acute infusion reactions were excluded.Results: In the 64 patients included, 38 were males with a meanage of 39 years. In our group of patients, the major indication forbiological therapy was the presence of active disease (78.1%). Themean duration of the treatment was 4 years (1-11). 78.1% weretaking 5 mg/Kg and the frequency of infusions was every 8 weeks in70.3%. 20.3% of patients were treated with azathioprine and 26.6%with aminosalicylates. We observed paradoxical inflammation eventsin 21 patients. The most common changes were skin reactions (folliculitis, eczema, psoriasis), followed by arthritis/arthralgia, lupus andauto-immune hepatitis. In 6 patients (28.6%) IFX had to be suspendedin order to solve the reaction (1 hepatitis, 2 lupus and 3 patients withpsoriasis) and specific therapy to this complication was started. Theeffects were more frequent in the group of patients taking 10 mg/kg(p=0.17) and less frequent with the concomitant use of azathioprine(p=0.22).Conclusions: In this study, paradoxical inflammation events werefrequent, although those requiring drug withdrawal were relativelyrare. Paradoxical inflammatory events should be treated with systemictherapy directed to the reaction and in most cases it may lead drugwithdrawal. Once under control, it is possible restart biologic therapy(with another anti-TNF agent or even the same in a lower dosage) tomaintain remission in IBD.",

Gram-negative bacilli, which were formerly the main microorganisms causing intra-hospital infections, have been replaced by gram-positive cocci, essentially Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The increasing number of staphylococcal infections, especially those associated with the use of peripheral or central venous catheters, by the increase in parenteral nutrition and by the use of pacemakers and prosthetic materials poses an important challenge to the treating physician. Since most of these infections are associated with bacteremia and septicemia, blood cultures are one of the most valuable complementary methods for a quick diagnosis. We will review the most useful microbiological parameters that can be applied when interpreting a blood culture isolate (especially if a CNS is isolated). We will also briefly explain the different causes of catheter-related bacteremia and the different rates of contamination and infection associated with the various percutaneous intravascular devices.",

The medications used were esomeprazole, ranitidine and sucralfate.Results: we assessed 511 patients with a mean age of 80.5years. 30% of the patients took AST before admission. Their use wasinappropriate in 69% of them. Among hospitalized patients, 89% of patients started AST during the hospitalization, and these 76%were unnecessary. At discharge, 48% of patients used AST, and most of them (61%) had no such indication.The inappropriate administration of AST increases the cost per patient.Conclusion: Results agree with the literature, with a highfrequency of incorrect AST prescription. A more accurate use of AST is recommended to avoid side effects and to reduce costs.",

            "resumo": "AbstractTreatment of HIV infection with highly active antiretroviral therapy(HAART) can induce severe metabolic complications, includinginsulin resistance, which is likely to confer an increased incidenceof cardiovascular disease. Both protease inhibitors (PI) and, to alesser extent, nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors(NRTIs) appear to be involved, through direct metabolic effects ofPI and an indirect effect of PI and NRTI. This definitions, metabolicsyndrome and insulin resistance, exist to identify those “at risk”and, although treatment is commonly recommended, antidiabetictherapy is likely to be of greater benefit in those patients witha greater perceived cardiovascular risk and the lowest risk ofHIV disease progression. The most effective strategies for thetreatment of diabetes in patients under HAART appear to be IPswitching and/or initial antidiabetic therapy administration, withmetformin or tioglitazones; however, all oral antidiabetics havetheir role in this patient’s type and are not significant interactionsbetween different antidiabetics and antiretroviral therapy weredescribed until now.",

At present, we must approach biblical texts withmultiple, integrated, or complementary approaches as theology,archeology, anthropology, mythology, sociology, paleoclimatology,epidemiology, etc. The assumption that events reported in theBible, especially in the Old Testament, happened as they weredescribed can no longer be accepted in an outright fashion, inthe light of current scientific progress. However, many of thebiblical narratives are based in events that took place, survivingfor several centuries through oral tradition from one generationto the other being written down at a later stage, according to avision coherent with the religious and cultural context of the time.Thus, the plagues described in Jews exodus from Egypt constitutea palimpsest of different epidemical outbreaks correlated mainlywith climatic changes that occurred then in the Middle East.",

In Portugal no studies have objectively analysedthe prevalence of such patients in Internal Medicine wards. This study aimed to characterize palliative care needs in InternalMedicine wards of a Central/University Hospital, to define the profile of patients, determining their needs and assessing theadequacy of care.Material and Methods: Prospective and observational study including 670 patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward ofa Central/University Hospital in a period of 9 consecutive weeks. Selection of patients in need of Palliative Care who answered aquestionnaire and a review of clinical files aiming to assess several variables, namely, disease leading to the need of palliative care,reason for admission, performance status, symptoms/symptom control measures and special care in agony.Results: The study determined palliative care needs in 15% of the hospitalized patients (54 cancer patients and 48 non cancerpatients), that presented multiple and intense symptoms, requiring complex therapy and extensive nursing care. Although mostsymptoms have improved there was insufficient symptomatic control, especially of anorexia, fatigue, depression and anxiety.There was also difficulty in the recognition of agony (achieved in only 1/3 of patients) and institution of the appropriate attitudesand therapeutic measures, with maintenance of futile therapy.Mortality was 31.3%. Of the patients discharged from the hospital only 3 were admitted in palliative care units.Conclusion: This study illustrates in an objective way the need for palliative care in Internal Medicine wards and points to theimportance of specific training of Internists in this particular area.",

Results: We included 120 patients witha mean age of 75.7 years and equal gender distribution. Themajority of patients lived accompanied at the time of admission.A quarter of patients had a medical history of ischemic stroke.The frequency of bedridden state, before admission, was 19.2%.Acute ischemic stroke was the commonest primary diagnosis. Themean length of hospital stay was 15 days and increased to 23days for nonmedical reasons (social problems). At discharge themajority of patients presented a high degree of dependency forbasic activities of daily living. Thirty four patients were dischargedto “Rede Nacional de Cuidados Continuados Integrados” [National Network for Integrated Continuous Care].Conclusion: Acute carehospitals must prepare themselves for the needs of an ageingpopulation. Functional decline among hospitalized patients is common, and often a major obstacle in the reintegration into society.",

Portugal is the WesternEuropean country with the highest prevalence of HIV infection,presenting an increasing number of new cases.Objective and Methods: We retrospectively characterized andcompared two groups of patients with HIV infection followed inan outpatient clinic of a Lisbon hospital. The first group includedpatients that had been diagnosed in 1997/1998, and the secondgroup included patients diagnosed in 2007/2008. Our purposewas to ascertain any differences between the groups concerningdemography, epidemiology, clinical presentation, laboratory parameters and therapy.Results: We evaluated 74 patients diagnosed with HIV infectionin 1997/1998 and 106 diagnosed in 2007/2008. The averageage at the time of diagnosis was higher in 2007/2008 (37.8 vs33.1 years). The male gender was predominant in both periods,without significant difference. There were more foreign patientsin 2007/2008 (50% vs. 20.3%). There was an increase inheterosexual transmission (65.1% vs. 48.6%) and a decreasednumber of cases associated with injection drug use (3.8% vs.32.4%) in 2007/2008. There were no significant differences ofpatients diagnosed on initial stage C between the two groups. Inthe 1997/1998 period, patients needed to take a higher numberof pills distributed by a higher number of times per day.Conclusions: The investment in strategies to reduce the riskof HIV transmission and early diagnosis is crucial. With a moreeffective prevention and an early institution of antiretroviral therapy, we expect to become more effective, easier and safer, dayby day, and perhaps one day we will achieve the epidemic control.Key words: HIV infection, AIDS, epidemiology, transmission,prevention, behaviour, antiretroviral therapy.",

Whenthese lesions reoccur for three or more episodes per year, arenamed as Recurrent Oral Ulceration (ROU). Although recurringulcers might be associated with other disorders, ROU usuallyexpresses a primary problem.The main objectives of this study were 1) to determine the prevalence of ROU in the general Portuguese population, composedby people randomly approached without any acute disease; 2) tocompare the observed prevalence with the prevalence of ROU inother countries and 3) to compare the prevalence of this problemin patients with other systemic diseases where ROU is included.A population of six hundred persons was enquired regarding theage of the disease onset; place of residence, factors triggeringoutbreaks, usual treatments and family incidence. Besides, itwas carried out the identification of other diseases associatedwith ROU as well as the relevant pathological background. Theprevalence of ROU was 19.0% in this general population, withpredominance of 22.7% in women, compared with 14.0% in men,being this difference statistically significant (p<0.05). In most ofthe affected individuals, the first ulceration appeared before thetwenties. Certain food, oral trauma, stress, fever, menstrual cycle,presence of acute disease, some medications/drugs and smokingcessation have been identified as precipitation factors associatedwith ROU. In 9.6% of the affected people it was not possible toidentify any cause for recurrent ulcers. We also found that 45.6%of the population with ROU has direct relatives, up to first degree,also affected by this problem",

Except for theMiller-Fishervariant of GBS, it is characterized bythe absence of osteotendinous reflexes and ascending flaccid muscleparalysis of variable magnitude, which may progress to respiratoryfailure by paralysis of respiratory muscles. Analytically, the maincharacteristic finding is the cerebro-spinal-fluid albumin-cytologic dissociation. The electromyogram helps the diagnosis, butit’s more useful in identifying the clinical variant. The authorspresent the cases of GBS requiring hospitalization in the IntensiveCare Unit (ICU) in our hospital. The aim of this study was toevaluate the demographic, clinical disease, type of variantand response to therapy. We also analyzed the complications andhospitalization time and its relation to the clinical variant of thedisease.Material and Methods: A retrospective study of GBS cases diagnosed in the last 10 years, requiring hospitalization in the IntensiveCare Unit (from the 31st January 2001 to the 31st January 2011),through the analysis of their clinical files.Results: Of the twenty-one patients diagnosed with GBS in theselected period,seven patients required admission to the ICU, all dueto respiratory failure. It were five men and two women. The meanage was 50.8 years. A precipitating event was identified in twopatients. Four patients evolved rapidly (less than 5 days to hospitalization in ICU) and all of these had axonal variants. There weresigns of autonomic dysfunction in 43% of patients. All had albumincytologic dissociation. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation(MV) was 24.4 days, and this was higher in axonal forms.The averagetime of stay in ICU and hospital were, respectively, 29.7 days and 93.4days, being higher in axonal forms. All patients received intravenousimmunoglobulin. There were no complications associated withtreatment.Conclusion:Axonal variants are associated with a quicker diseaseprogression and severe neurological deficits, which are reflected inprolonged time of MV and hospitalization. These are also associatedwith lower recovery rates and increased morbidity and mortality.Treatment was directed towards modifying the course of the disease,and in this respect both plasmapheresis and intravenous humanimmunoglobulin have similar efficacy. Supportive care, including respiratory care and treatment of autonomic dysfunction are extremelyimportant to avoid potentially fatal complications.",

The incidence of CDADincreased almost six fold between 2004 and 2009 (4.35/1000 vs.21.63/1000), and 77.11% developed the disease during hospitalization. The disease was more frequent in women (11.64/1000vs. 6.16/1000). All patients had undergone prior antibiotherapy.The comorbidities, number of antibiotics used, advanced age,duration of the antibiotherapy and the length of hospitalizationdid not seem to justify the increase in incidence and severity. In96% the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of Clostridiumtoxin and in 4% by colonoscopy. Seventy three patients (88%)were treated with metronidazole and 30% died (the departmentoverall mortality was 13%). Probably, it was the advanced agerelated with the worst severity scenario which caused the highmortality in our cases.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: Paraquat is a contact herbicide commercially available since 1962. Paraquat intoxication (PI) is usually voluntaryand highly lethal, since there is no effective antidote. Toxicityoccurs through cyclic redox reactions, damaging mainly thekidneys and lungs.Aim, material and methods: featuring the clinical presentation,management and outcome of patients with PI over an 18 yearsperiod (from the 01st January 1993 to the 31st December 2010)through the retrospective analysis of clinical files and comparingthe survivors and the deceased.Results: Thirty-one cases of Paraquat intoxication were included, with a male: female ratio 1:1. Age range from 13 to 80 years,mean age 42.4years (±18.7).All intoxications were voluntary andby oral route. There was statistical difference in the amount ingested (22.1 mL vs. 72.7 mL, p<0.0005). A non-significant trendto a longer delay until getting medical attention in the deceasedgroup (1.6 h vs. 3.2 h, p=0.091). Statistical significance was foundbetween mortality and leukocytosis, hypocapnea, hypoxemia, LDH,alkaline phosphatase and AST. There was no difference betweengroups according to treatment options, although hemocarboperfusion was used more often in the deceased group (53.9%vs. 66.7%, p=0.471) and corticosteroids in the survivor group(61.5% vs. 44.4%, p=0.350). Mortality rate was 58.1% (66.7%in the first 72 hours), due to respiratory insufficiency and multipleorgan failure. Variable levels of pulmonary fibrosis occurred in38.5% of the survivors.Discussion & Conclusion: Paraquat intoxication has a poorprognosis with limited efficiency of treatment approaches. Therelation between Paraquat in the urine and the time elapsed afteringestion is the main determinant factor in the prognosis. In thisstudy the presence of dyspnea, hypocapnea and hypoxemia waslinked to a bad prognosis. There was no statistical differencebetween the available treatment options.",

Fever, constitutional symptoms, splenomegaly and pancytopenia are the most characteristic features.Ocular involvement with intra-retinal haemorrhage is very rare.Diagnosis can be difficult as parasite identification is not alwayspossible, serological tests have suboptimal sensitivity, and molecular biology techniques, like Polymerase Chain Reaction, areoften unavailable in clinical practice.Except in India, antimonial drugs have been first choice therapy,although there is a trend towards Amphotericin in immunocompromised patients.In this case-report we present a 35-years-old patient, residentin an endemic area of the disease, HIV-seronegative, with a longstanding condition of constitutional symptoms, fever, massivesplenomegaly and pancytopenia. Attempts to isolate the parasitewere of no avail; there was no evidence of another disease,and serological tests results for Leishmania were positive andstrongly suggestive of active infection. Just before beginningantimony treatment, the patient mentioned blurred vision andan ophthalmologic examination showed bilateral retinal haemorrhages. Full ocular and clinic laboratorial recovery ensued alongthe treatment course.We report this case due to the unusual ocular lesions in VLand complexity issues concerning the diagnosis. With this paperwe also want to remind that, in spite of its rarity in developedcountries, VL should not be underestimated in a patient with asuggestive clinical condition.",

The mostfrequent risk factors were biliary and abdominal surgery, alcoholhabits and diabetes. Clinical presentation was more frequentlyacute and common manifestations were fever, chills and rightupper quadrant abdominal pain. Most frequent laboratory abnormalities included leukocytosis with neutrophilia, increase onthe erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum C–reactive protein,decrease on albumin and increase on aminotransferases, alkalinephosphatase and gamma glutamyl-transpeptidase. Ultrasoundand computed tomography were performed in the majority ofpatients. Blood cultures, performed in all patients, were positive infive. Serological tests were positive in 3 patients. Needle aspirationwas performed in half of the patients, with inconclusive results.Eight patients went through percutaneous catheter drainage.Antibiotics were administered for a mean duration of 33.8 days.There was a good clinical response in 15 patients and one caseof recurrence.Conclusions: the profile of our patients with LA was similar tothose referred in the literature, however the pathogen identificationwas only achieved in half of them.

We evaluated the capacity of anincreased carotid intimal-media thickness (IMT) or the presence ofcarotid high-risk atherosclerotic plaques to predict the presenceof complex atheromatosis of the aortic arc.Results: A total of 101 ischemic stroke patients were sent toour laboratory for TEE and carotid ultrasound. Considering thepresence of complex atheromatosis of the aortic arch as thedependent variable, increased carotid IMT had a sensitivity of42% and a specificity of 78% (positive predictive value 41%,negative predictive value 80%), and carotid high-risk plaques hada sensitivity of 22% and a specificity of 95% (positive predictivevalue 60%, negative predictive value 77%).Conclusions: In this study, a carotid ultrasound scan with anabnormal IMT or high-risk plaques had a high specificity for thepresence of complex atheromatosis of the aortic arch, with alow sensitivity.",

Genetic, endocrine, neuroendocrine,behavioral and environmental factors play an important role in theiretiopathogenesis. The diagnosis is made based on the body massindex and waist circumference. The prevention and treatment arenecessary, since an excessive morbidity and mortality can belinked to obesity and its associated disorders mainly cardiovascular and metabolic. Proper nutrition and increased physical activityare the main focus of these measures. Adjuvant pharmacologicalintervention (orlistat) is recommended for patients with concomitant overweight- or obesity-related diseases and for whom dietand physical activity have not been successful. Bariatric surgery isreserved for patients with severe obesity or those with moderateobesity associated with a serious medical condition, after at leastone year of an inefficient conservative treatment. The purpose ofthis review is to assess all these aspects.",

As amatter of fact, loop diuretics and vasodilator agents are still themainstay of therapy in this situation. The new drugs introduced inthe clinical practice had their use limited by concerns regardingtheir safety, like nesiritide and levosimendan, or their efficacy, liketolvaptan. Both ultrafiltration and specialized heart failure unitshad a better outcome but their implementation has been limited due to logistic problems.The disease has a somber prognosis.

There was a medical prescriptionof oxygen in 97.7% of the audited episodes. A complete “fixeddose” oxygen prescription was present in only 51.2%. Just 51.1%episodes of oxygen administration fully respected the transcription.Monitoring was the same as transcribed in 86.7% episodes.Oxygen therapy, although being a common treatment in mosthospitals for acute conditions, is not implemented according tointernational recommendations of care.

Hyperthyroidism and diffuse goiter due to autoimmunethyroiditis were diagnosed, with positive anti-thyroperoxidaseand anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. A 3 cm sub-areolar masswas noted in the right breast, diffuse, firm and slightly painful,with no lymph node enlargement. Several fine-needle aspiration cytologies were negative for malignant cells; core biopsyshowed periductal, vascular and lobular phenotypically normallymphocytic infiltration with severe stromal fibrosclerosis. Thepatient was prescribed thiamazole withdrawn after progressionfor hypothyroidism. Attempt to treat the SLL with oral corticoidtherapy was not successful. About 1.5 years after the diagnosisof autoimmune thyroiditis, mastopathy remains stable with fewsymptoms without specific treatment.Discussion: The etiology of breast LLE is unknown, but itsstrong association with autoimmune diseases and increasedexpression of HLA-DR in affected epithelial cells suggests thatan immune reaction to components of the mammary stroma canlead to fibro-inflammatory changes. To date, there is no evidenceof neoplastic potential although data are scarce. It is unknownwhether treatment of the underlying autoimmune disease mayinfluence the natural history of this disease.

A different approach of those procedures and resultsimplies an involvement and a motivation of Health Care professionals. Theperformance of a Health Service is nowadays linked to the level of accessand organization of the clinical information. In such context, a correctand complete documentation of the patient’s clinical data is essentialfor the practice of a quality Medical care, being the clinical record thebasis of a hospital management and structure.Aim: the endpoint of this work was to compare 2004 and 2005 regarding the quality criteria of medical records, proposed with predefinedvariables, to determine the rate of achievement.Material and Methods: a descriptive and transverse observation studybased on the medical record of each patient, referring to the year 2004and to the year 2005. The predefined variables were the existence of aclassic clinical history, the ward admission notice, the hospital dischargenotice, the patient’s problems list, based on Weed’s method and therecord of laboratorial analysis on a specific registration sheet. The reasons why the hospitalization was extended where also assessed not onlymeasuring it but also identifying the causes of such delay. There werea total of 1031 (F554; M507) patients admitted in 2004 with a meanage was 70 years [15-103] and the average hospitalization period was7,6 days [1-78]. In the year of 2005 there were a total of 1030 (F531;M499) patients admitted, with a mean age of 71 years [16-99] and theaverage hospitalization period was 8 days [1-101].Results: In both years, 2004 and 2005, the admission notice was recorded in 100% of patients, excluding the cases where the Clinical Historywas recorded. With exception of patients deceased and transferred toother services, the Discharge Notice was also complied with in 100% ofcases. The classical clinical history was made in 213 patients (21%) in2004 and in 87 patients (8.5%) in 2005. The laboratory analysis sheetand the Weed’s list were recorded in 866 (84%) and 847 patients (82%)in 2004 and in 898 (87%) and 863 patients (84%) in 2005, respectively.The extended hospitalization was verified in 11% and 9% of the patients(2004 and 2005), respectively; the social problems were the major causesin the first year and the clinical problems in the second.Conclusion: regarding the clinical record we consider very positive theresults achieved. However it is a reason for concern the limited numberof Clinical Histories recorded, as well as its reduction when compared to2004. On the extended hospitalization on Medicine 1 ward, the clinicalissues are as important as the social ones.

Histologically(WHO classification), 3% of all cases had high aggressive features (Burkitt lymphoma), 68% aggressive and 29% indolent.Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounted for 51% andMALT lymphoma for 14% of all cases. According to InternationalPrognostic Index (IPI), 7% of our patients were in the high riskgroup, 3% in the intermediate high, 20% in the intermediate lowand 70% in the low risk group.In conclusion, PE-NHL is a heterogeneous group of diseases,most of them localized in the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Wefound a higher percentage of T phenotype cases than those fornodal NHL. DLBCL was the most frequent histological subtypelymphoma. IPI was predictive of survival, but its use is uncertainon PE-NHL, because it can not stratify patients homogeneously",

The epidemiologic characterization was, as expected, an old and dependentpopulation, with a major presence of cardiovascular diseasesfollowed by respiratory diseases. Regarding the population, 73%of deaths were expected, but just 44% were considered to bein palliative care. Pain was evaluated predominantly in cancerpatients, being treated in 77% of cases. The decision of palliative care was discussed with the family in 26% of patients, butit was not discussed with the patient him/herself.

Thus, the occurrence of hydatid disease is analyzedat several levels: Country, Great Regions, Alentejo, Evora district,and the counties of this district.The final conclusion is that the majority of the Country is, ingeneral, sine endemic in human hydatid disease, the only occurrences being sporadic cases that are, more often than not, theresult of old infections. As far as the Alentejo is concerned – in thepast the largest endemic region of Portugal – there are countiesin the districts of Portalegre and Beja that are sine endemic, andsome hypo-endemic; only the district of Évora has a few countiesthat are meso-endemic and only one that is hyper-endemic.",

According to capillaroscopic criteria they were classified in three groups: primary RP, secondary RP due to a probableConnective Tissue Disease (CTD) and secondary RP to SystemicSclerosis (SS).According to the final clinical diagnosis made in later consultations (medium follow-up 2,3 years), patients were also placedinto three groups (primary RP, DCT and SS).The sample comprised 286 individuals: 40 with SS pattern,111 with probable CTD and 135 with primary RP.Differences of the alterations among the 3 groups were verysignificant. In primary RP we observed more stasis (38,5%), andedema (35,6%), in CTD, serious dystrophies (89,2%) and in SSedema and blurred capillary outlines in all patients.Tests for sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were highas well as statistical index among the various pathologies (Cohen K = 0.87).We concluded that NCM criteria are an important help todifferentiate the etiology of RF.The high sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and statisticalagreement levels make it possible to recommend NCM as thefirst step exam for the evaluation of patients with RP.",

            "resumo": "AbstractPostmenopausal osteoporosis is a highly prevalent worldwideskeletal disease. It is characterized by low bone mass, leadingto extensive bone fragility. Osteoporosis diagnosis is made onthe basis of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy x-rayabsorptiometry (DXA). The major complications are fractures. Theprevention and treatment of osteoporosis are aimed at reducingsubstantially the fractures. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may slow the rate of bone loss or mildly increase BMD.Bisphosphonates are currently the most used drugs, they reduceosteoclast activity and are potent inhibitors of bone resorption.Strontium ranelate is an alternative to bisphosphonates. Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, prevents boneloss, like estrogen, but probably without prejudicial side effectsof estrogen. Estrogen alone, or in combination with progesteron,is now seldom used. Calcitonin, a peptide produced by thyroid Ccells, inhibits bone resorption, but its clinical efficacy is moderate.Teriparatide, a parathyroid hormone analogue, is an potent boneanabolic agent that increases bone formation; however, thismedication is reserved for severe cases. Balanced nutrition withadequate calcium and vitamin D intake, physical activity and loadbearing exercise seem to be effective in maintaining or increasingBMD. Also, it is necessary to instruct the patients, concerning theprevention of osteoporotic fractures.",

The present phase ofknowledge allows us to expect the use of skeletal myoblasts orautologous stem cells to become safe, feasible and effective.Available data suggest the benefit of the use of myoblasts incardiac function with improvement of the left ventricular ejectionfraction, decreasing of end diastolic and end systolic volumes.Increasing of the contractility of the ischaemic area, diminishingof the functional NYHA class and decreasing of the new casesof revascularization and hospitalizations are envisaged. Nevertheless the mechanisms by which these cells provide repair arestill unknown. However the cell differentiation into myocites, thepromotion of angiogenesis, paracrine factors secretion whichincrease the function of the surviving myocites, inhibition of cellmatrix destruction and of the apoptosis of cardiomyocites andfusion between transplanted cells and resident cells have beenproposed as possible explanations.We must underline that neither the best locus to collect stemcells or the best way of their management is cleared up.There are also some issues related to technical difficultiesand emerging complications that are still not solved. Hopefullyundergoing research will enlighten most of our doubts and willallow us to reach conclusions.",

A 72 h fast test, serumlevels of insulin and C-peptide strongly suggested insulinoma.Preoperative tumour localization was achieved by means of MRIand selective angiography that revealed a 2 cm nodule in the tailof the pancreas; ultrasonography (US), computed tomographyand Octreoscan were not helpful.Surgical resection was performed and splenic vein bloodsample showed insulin levels of 5410 mcUI/ml and 186 mcUI/ml respectively, before and after tumour extraction.Histopathology was consistent with the diagnosis of benign Insulinoma.There was a favourable clinical evolution, with complete normalization of the clinical symptoms and laboratory.",

The methodology used in the process of revision was a detailed analysis ofa set of articles obtained by inquiry Medline and Google, clinictrails and revisions, including the last 15 years of investigation inthe stroke area. In spite of being difficult to establish the pathogenesis of an ischemic cerebral infarction, his determination is ofextreme importance once that it is determinative of the therapeuticdirection. The more frequent embolic focus is the heart and thefirst step in the determination of the potential pathogenesis isthe recognition of the embolic potential of the cardiopathy. Atrialfibrillation is the more frequent major risk cardiopathy. In primaryprevention, patients with one or more high risk factors must betreated with oral anticoagulant and patients with low risk must betreated by anti-platelets drugs. In patients with moderated risk thetherapeutic choice depends on the preferences of the patient, theindividual haemorrhagic risk and the possibility of the efficientlycontrol of the anticoagulant therapy. On secondary prevention thedecision must be based in the most probable cause of cerebralinfarction, so the subtype of cerebral infarction has an importantrole in the choice of the secondary preventive therapy.",

In the baseline study the main reason for TM request wasdiagnosis while in the post-interventional study it screening. Inboth studies the majority of appropriate requests were done forscreening. In both studies most of inappropriate requests weredone for diagnosis. In the baseline study 17, 5% of the requestswere considered appropriate and there were an increase of appropriateness (TM appropriated in the post-interventional study:46%). There was an important decrease in the total costs relatedto TM, mainly due to a decrease in the costs of inappropriate requests.Discussion: The present study shows that informative and “self-audit “activities can have a positive impact in the clinicalpractice, with a decreased in costs.",

These signsshould be recognized and necessary procedures predicted.Methods: Retrospective evaluation of alert signs and symptomsin the 6 hours before death, decision of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)and attitudes chosen in deceased patients in a 3 year period.Results: Four hundred and three patient files were reviewed(mortality rate 11,4%). Mortality was homogeneously distributedin respect to week day and time. Alert signs and symptoms inthe 6 hours before death were identified in 291 patients (72,2%),specially: depressed level of consciousness (129 patients), desaturation (104) and dyspnoea (92). Doctors were called in 133cases and their attitudes were: reversion in 70 patients, relievingin 67, no attitude at all in 60 and assuming DNR in 40. The DNRwas present in 348 patients (86,4%) and registered in 92,0%.Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was attempted in 2 patients(0,5%) with explicit DNR and in 1 (0,2%) with implicit DNR. CPRwas not attempted in 35 patients (8,7%), although there was norecorded indication in the patient file for DNR.Conclusions: Alert signs and symptoms preceded most CRA,allowing an opportunity for intervention. Mostly nurses identifiedthese signs. The indication for DNR was recorded in the files ofmost patients. The low number of patients with indication for CPRis a surrogate of patient’s complexity.

            "resumo": "AbstractContext: Tuberculosis (Tb) is the 2nd death cause from infectious disease in the world. Portugal is a high incidence country. In the majority of Hospitals in Portugal, Tb patients are initialy admitted to Internal Medicinewards. In the absence of isolation rooms with negative pressure, there arerecommendations for other attitudes that minimize the risk of nosocomialtransmission of Tb.Objectives: To evaluate the risk-control attitudes that were takenfacing hospitalized Tb patients in an Internal Medicine ward of a generalHospital; to quantify the time of permanence of potencially infectious patients in the ward.Patients and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the hospitalizedpatients with Tb at an Internal Medicine ward with 33 beds, during theperiod of 3 years. Inclusion criteria: previous Tb diagnosis with lessthan 4 weeks of treatment; diagnosis during the hospitalization, withtreatment decision; microbiological diagnosis after withdrawal fromthe ward. Evaluated attitudes: “separation” (curtains, increasing bedintervals); use of mask; high efficiency particle aspirator; transference to other institution.Results: In a total of 2810 admissions, 39 cases of Tb were included(1,4%), 25 of them with pulmonary forms of disease. Sixteen of thesewere high risk transmitters, with positive direct or cultural microbiological identification in respiratory secretions. The hospitalizations of thesepatients completed 303 days (162 until the diagnosis and 141 after thediagnosis), most of them (169 days) without risk-control attitudes. Amongthe 141 days after the diagnosis, only in 7 were risk-control attitudesnot taken. Risk-control attitudes were taken in 14 patients, all of themwith pulmonary Tb. The 2 remaining patients only had cultural diagnosis,after withdrawal from the ward.Discussion and conclusions: In 14 of the 16 infectious patients, therecommended risk-control attitudes were taken, after the diagnosis.Despite this acceptable accomplishement, there were 169 hospitalizationdays with risk of transmission, wich we can relate to late suspicion and/or diagnosis. It is necessary to reduce the treshold for suspicion andrisk-control attitudes. The authors present some proposals that mightreduce the nosocomial exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",

In our series therewas no correlation between the stage of the HIV infection andthe clinical manifestations at the time of admission. Given that noassociation was found between the initial clinical manifestationsand opening pressure in the initial lumbar puncture, the formercan not be taken as a trustworthy indicator of the need to lightenthe intracranial pressure. Our work re-emphasises the importanceof evaluating the opening pressure, as a means to diagnose intracranial hypertension. The drainage of liquor, eventually backed byappropriate neurosurgical techniques, is an adequate alternativemethod to alleviate intracranial hypertension, when strong evidence supporting the use of medication for that purpose is scarce.The reduction of mortality and morbidity relies on an aggressiveapproach, which combines the use of anti-fungal therapy withexternal drainage, or even peritoneal shunting.",

Increasing attention has been devoted to areas like its pathological mechanisms and the search fornew therapeutic strategies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) isindicated for many disorders, and investigation on its mechanismsof action has yielded some preliminary findings, especially on itseffects on the immune activity. The spectrum for its therapeuticuse, although very controversial, has been increasing, mainly insituations involving auto-immune processes. There are a fewwritten cases on the use of IVIg in the SS’s treatment, especiallywhen neurological manifestations occur. In this paper we reviewthe interest of using IVIg in SS, and analyze the published casereports of its use. We find that IVIg seems an important therapeutic option for many cases of SS. Accumulating data suggests arational for its use as second line option in cases of extraglandularmanifestations resistant to conventional treatment.",

Despite these limitations and challenges, and afterconfirming the diagnosis, determining the clinical and serologicsubgroup of the patient, assessing extramuscular manifestationsand defining the relative contribution of disease activity anddamage to the patient’s condition, a therapeutic plan should be developed and followed.Although corticosteroids remain the mainstay of an initial treatment plan, combination immunosuppressive regimens and othernovel disease-modifying immunologic agents are new additions tothe therapeutic arsenal of inflammatory myopathy.

            "resumo": "AbstractINTRODUCTION: Systemic sclerosis (SSc), an immunologic disorder ofunknown aetiology, is characterized by progressive tissue fibrosis, localized or diffuse.The diffuse sub-type and prolonged course of the disease are associatedwith increased risk of visceral involvement, mainly of the lungs and kidneys.Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) and scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) are notmutually exclusive, but they are rarely associated; however, both are importantcauses of death in these patients. Mortality in SS is four times that of thegeneral population; mainly in the first 3-5 years, the overall survival rate at 15 years is around 50%.We report a case of this rare association and present a brief review ofpathophysiology and therapeutics.CASE REPORT: A 56 year-old female, caucasian, SSc diagnosed 3,5 yearsbefore, treated with vasodilators, oral anticoagulation (due to recurrent deepvenous thrombosis) and corticosteroids (she had fibrosing alveolitis, andwas previously treated with 13 pulses of cyclofosfamide with a favourable response).She was admitted with fever, arterial hypertension, periorbital oedema andworsening renal function. A bilateral pleural effusion was diagnosed, withoutalveolitis, it was a transudate. ANA e anti-Scl-70 were positive, ANCA andantiphospholipid being negative. The echocardiogram disclosed PHT and apericardial effusion without haemodynamic compromise. Ultrasound of thekidneys was normal. Oedema and blood pressure improved on captopril;however renal function rapidly worsened with oliguria, so a renal biopsy (RB)was made and she began hemodialysis due to uremia and fluid overload.RB histology was typical of SRC. Renal function had no improvement underdialysis. In the 29th day of hospitalization she had typical signs of pulmonaryembolism, and treatment began with IV heparin; latter a cardiorespiratoryarrest with assystole ensued, that didn’t responded to cardiopulmonary ressuscitation.DISCUSSION: SRC is more frequently associated with diffuse SSc andanti-Scl-70. Its hallmark is an abrupt onset of severe arterial hypertensionand rapidly progressive renal failure with hiperreninemia.It may coexist a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia similar to hemolyticuremic syndrome.Therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improved survivaland prognosis, reducing the necessity of dialysis, and sometimes allowingsuspension of renal replacement therapy.Overlap syndrome / renal vasculitis was considered a possibility due topoliserositis and recurrent deep venous thrombosis. Corticosteroid theraphyis likely associated with onset of SRC.There have been reports linking SRC with the onset of PHT in SSc. Someauthors consider there is a common pathophysiology, namely the coexistence of renal and pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy with myocardial dysfunction.",

The main manifestations includedacute myocardial infarction in two patients, pulmonary thromboembolism in two, one patient with mesenteric thrombosis, onewith venous sinus thrombosis, 10 had 21 foetal losses (86%occurred during the second and third trimester) and 13 had deepvein thrombosis. Other clinical manifestations were thrombocytopaenia in six patients, livedo reticularis in four, anaemia in three,migraine in three and one with transient cerebral ischaemia. Fourfemale patients had successful term pregnancies. Three patientshad recurrent thrombosis (two with deep vein thrombosis and onepulmonary thromboembolism) despite anticoagulant treatment.The most frequent initial antiphospholipid syndrome manifestations were deep vein thrombosis (44.8%) and pregnancy loss(34.5%). During the 29 months follow-up (3-29 months, mean14 months) no patients developed Systemic Lupus Erythematosus(SLE) or other autoimmune disease.",

Thediagnosis is clinical and it can be difficult to make in the presenceof doubtful symptoms of neuroglycopenia or adrenergic symptomsafter meals. Whipple’s triad of - glycaemia below 50 mg/dl andsymptoms / signs of hypoglycaemia that revert with administration of glucose - is strongly suggestive of insulinoma, and whenassociated with blood insulin inappropriately high, is diagnostic ofinsulinoma. The authors describe the case of a 58-year-old malepatient, with a clinical picture characterized by multiple episodesof confusion, migraine, bewilderment, irritability, agitation anddiaphoresis, of nearly 8 months duration. The complaints werenot properly evaluated initially and the patient was treated withsedative drugs. A fasting glycaemia of 38 mg/dl made insulinomaa probable diagnosis, and this was confirmed by the 72 hourfast test. Difficulties arose, as usual, in locating the tumour withimaging methods (ultrasound, tomography scan, octreotide scanand endoscopic ultrasound) and only selective arteriography withcatheterization of the branches of the coeliac artery revealed thetumour, located in the head of the pancreas. Surgical treatmentconsisted of tumour enucleation. The histological findings confirmed the diagnosis of benign insulinoma.

Wegener´s granulomatosis, microscopis polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome are describedas small vessel vasculitides strongly associated with ANCA. Thediagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis is made on the basis ofclinical findings, by biopsy of a relevant involved organ and thepresence of ANCA. However, the application of ANCA testing as aclinical diagnostic tool is still regarded as controversial.

The paediatric and geriatric age group benefited most from this.The closing of Emergency Room services in the United Statesand Canada, and the increase of accessibility to primary care inthe United Kingdom and Spain, have not contributed to control theincrease in number and appropriateness of, emergency consultations. In practice there has been a constant growth resulting in theinevitable congestion of the Casualty/Emergency Room services.The predicted closure of the Espinho hospital Unit is expected tocause a work overload for the referral hospital as well as a negativeeconomic impact on the National Health Service.",

When there is mass necrosis,these tumours may reveal themselves through a huge release ofhormones. We present the case of a 42 year old female attendinga Hypertension outpatient clinic because of fainting episodes andhigh blood pressure. She was diagnosed with hypertension at theage of 18 years and was being treated for severe depression.She had no complaints until 3 months earlier when she startedsuffering from “hard-to-assess” episodes of fatigue, trembling,headache, blurred vision and faintness. SBP was 160-200mmHg. She had a slow psychomotor response and reduced facial expression.She presented with inconsistently elevated urinary metanephrines and CT scan showed a 3.4 cm mass, with a necrotic center,in her left adrenal gland. Phaeochromocytoma was confirmed withan IMBG scintigraphy. She underwent laparoscopic removal of themass and histology revealed phaeochromocytoma.Discussion: A diagnosis of Phaeochromocytoma is hard tomake because of a number of factors: the rising number ofincidentalomas; the technical difficulty in combining biochemicaland imaging exams; numerous drug interactions with biochemicalresults as well as a lack of clinical suspicion when facing unusualpresenting features, such as hypotension.

Our aim was to evaluate the demographics, stroketype, risk factors, outcome and mortality in patients younger than 60 years.Methods: Prospective study lasting 2 years (2002- 2003) of allpatients aged under 60, admitted with stroke, to our department.Patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage were excluded. Thestudy protocol included history, physical examination, computedtomography (CT), ECG, transthoracic cardiac ultrasound, carotidDoppler, blood analysis for pro-clotting and atherogenic factorsand a 6-month follow-up. Other studies were performed when deemed necessary.Results: We studied 58 patients, 30 women (51.7%) and 28men (48.3%) aged 32 to 60 (mean age 51.9±6,3). The majority(77.6%) had ischaemic stroke, 20% had haemorrhagic strokeand one patient had thrombosis of the venous sinus. The mainrisk factors for ischaemic stroke were hypertension (66.7%) andhyperlipidemia (64.4%); and for hemorrhagic stroke hypertension(75%) and alcoholism (58.3%). The overall mortality was 13.8%.Only 43.1% of all patients recovered without sequelae.Conclusions: Besides age, the classic risk factors for atherosclerosis were the main risk factors identifiable, althoughalcoholism was the second risk factor for haemorrhagic stroke.The high percentage of mortality and disability associated withstroke underlines the absolute need to control these risk factors in the population.",

            "resumo": "AbstractThalidomide was commercialized in 1956 to be used as a sedativeand anti-emetic drug, but was rapidly removed from the market afterit had been linked to cases of severe birth defects. Nowadays the onlyapproved FDA indications for the use of Thalidomide are in MultipleMyeloma and Erithema Nodosum Leprosum. The anti-inflammatory,anti-angiogenic and anti-TNF alpha effect of the drug has led tocontinued interest and research about Thalidomide’s immunomodulatory activities. There are several clinical studies and many case reports of Thalidomide treatment for Behçet Disease (BD), with rapidhealing of the orogenital ulcers while patients are on Thalidomidebut with relapse after its discontinuation. Despite possible benefits,Thalidomide is difficult to obtain, available as an investigational agentonly (in most countries), carries a significant risk of neuropathy, andis generally reserved for resistant disease in patients who will notbecome pregnant. So, the use of Thalidomide in the managementof BD is restricted to experienced physicians.We report a group of seven patients with BD with painful oralaphthae who experienced rapid (2 to 4 weeks) complete and sustained improvement with Thalidomide after a prolonged but ineffective treatment with steroids and/or colchicine. No major side-effect wereexperienced (somnolence in two). Three patients who relapsed afterwithdrawal of Thalidomide, needed maintenance therapy at a lowerdose, to prevent relapse.In our group of 7 patients we confirm the benefit of Thalidomidein recurrent mucocutaneous aphthae and BD resistant to classicdrugs, without major side-effects. The effectiveness of Thalidomideis present even with low dosages, but treatment must be continuousbecause new lesions usually appear a few weeks after the end of treatment.",

We reviewed the literature on the subject andpresent a discussion on the causes of spontaneous ASDH with aspecial emphasis on anticoagulant treatment as a risk factor. Wedid not found any references for low molecular weight heparins inprophylactic regimes, as possible cause, for this kind of event.This case reminds us that, although rare, this entity must beconsidered even in the absence of head trauma, as early diagnosisand intervention may prevent a negative outcome",

Thisphenomenon has been designated as the “incretin effect”. Thiseffect is caused by the gastrointestinal peptides “gastric inhibitory polypeptide” (GIP) and “glucagon-like peptide-1” (GLP-1).These incretin hormones are responsible for the major part of postprandial insulin secretion.Preparations based on GLP-1 are able to reduce the incretineffect in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, oral administration ofGLP-1 is inefficient as GLP-1 is destroyed in the gastrointestinaltract. Subcutaneous or intravenous bolus GLP-1 is inactivated byplasma enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-4). GLP-1 is onlyefficient by continuous parenteral infusion.GLP-1 analogues/derivatives or incretin mimetics exendine-4,are active after subcutaneous injection, and DPP-4 inhibitors,sitagliptin and vildagliptin, given orally, are used in the treatmentof type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction: Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) is a hepatocellular inflammation of unknown cause, characterised by the presence ofinterface hepatitis on liver biopsy, and hypergammaglobulinaemia and autoantibodies in serum.Objective: To characterise clinical, laboratory and histological features, as well as the outcome, of AIH.Methods - Retrospective analysis of AIH cases admitted between 1987 and 2002 in an Internal Medicine Ward.Results: Twenty nine patients (pts), with a mean age of 34.2 ±16.4 years and a male-to-female ratio 1:28. The onset wasfulminant in 6.9%, acute in 20.7% and insidious or chronic in72.4%. Asthenia (65.6%), anorexia (48.3%), nausea and vomiting (48.3%), were the most common symptoms; 24.1% wereasymptomatic. Applying the scoring system of the InternationalAutoimmune Hepatitis Group, the diagnosis was definitive in 69%and probable in 31%. HAI type I was diagnosed in 86.2%, 3.5%were type II and in 10.3% none of the standard antibodies werefound. Two pts were positive for anti-VHC, 1 for HbsAg and 1 hada recent history of hepatitis A. Initial therapy was prednisolone in13 pts and prednisolone + azathioprine in 15. Complete responsewas achieved in 39.3%, partial response in 7.1%, failure in 25%and relapse in 28.6%. Four patients underwent liver transplantation. During a mean follow-up period of 69 months (range, 1 to213 months), the mortality was 13.8%: 2 pts died from hepaticfailure, 1 from sepsis and 1 from herpetic meningitis.Conclusions: At the time of diagnosis, 24.1% of the patientswere asymptomatic and 27.1% had cirrhosis; therapy with prednisolone and azathioprine was more effective than prednisolonemonotherapy; liver transplantation was required in 4 patients; theevolution was favourable in the majority of cases.",

Diarrhoea was definedas 3 or more loose watery stools during a 24-hour period. Patientswith colectomy or ileostomy were excluded. From a total of 461patients admitted, 140 met the inclusion criteria; of these, 52developed diarrhoea. For clinical characterisation the followingparameters were evaluated: age, gender, ICU stay, severity scores(APACHE II and SAPS II), therapy with antibiotics, serum urea andcreatinine, haemoglobin (Hg), serum proteins, co-morbilities andICU mortality. Patients with and without diarrhoea were comparedregarding the above parameters. Comparison was performed withstudent t- test; correlation between numerical variables was performed with linear regression analysis; logistic regression analysiswas performed to identify independent predictive parameters formortality in patients with diarrhoea.Results: Patients with diarrhoea had lower Hg (p=0,007), higherserum urea (p=0,014) and higher mortality (p<0,001). Deceasedpatients with diarrhoea presented a lower Hg (p=0,001) and ahigher serum urea (p=0,0014) and creatinine (p=0,03). Hg wasindependently related to mortality in patients with diarrhoea (p=0,002).Conclusions: Patients who developed diarrhoea in an ICU presented higher mortality, lower Hg, higher serum urea and morefrequent cephalosporin use (p=0,02).

The disease hasseveral aetiologies and assumes special importance in patientswith multiple risk factors. Due to the difficulty in identifying thedisease, a high level of suspicion is required in order to make the diagnosis.We described the clinical case of a 33 year-old man, infectedwith human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with progressivemultifocal leukoencephalopathy for 6 years. The patient waspartially dependent for daily living activities and was admittedfor aetiological evaluation of bone pain and decreased muscularstrength, progressively intensifying over the course of one year.Abnormal images were seen on a bone scan.The evidence of multiple risk factors for vitamin D deficiency,the presence of hypophosphatemia and imaging issues, raisedthe suspicion of osteomalacia due to vitamin D deficiency. Thisdiagnosis was confirmed: analytically (low level of vitamin Dmetabolites), histologically and by therapeutic response.A brief review is made of the factors influencing vitamin D bonemetabolism and their importance in maintaining a proper immunological response. It is mentioned that the absence of clinicalsuspicion may be responsible for many undiagnosed cases.In patients infected with HIV who present with an obscureclinical picture, we should also consider pathological entities notdirectly in relation to immunodeficiency, as they may be treated and have a better prognosis.",

She had a hospitaladmission for aseptic meningitis in 2000 and recovered withouttreatment. In 2005 she was admitted with fever and headaches. Hercerebrospinal fluid (CSF) had 152 leucocytes/µL (97% mononuclear),proteins 2.32 g/L and glucose 0.39 g/L. Microbiologic and serologicexams were negative for Mycobacteriae, Herpesvirus, Enterovirus,Cryptococcus, Borrelia and Treponema palidum. She had CD4 Tlymphocytes 590/µL and her viral load was 9764 copies/mL in serumand 9998 copies/mL in CSF. She recovered again with no treatment.A cerebral MRI showed multiple sub-cortical enhanced signal foci inthe temporal and frontal lobes, which had been present since 2000,asymptomatic and with no defined aetiology.Neurological manifestations in the acute HIV-1 infection correlatewith viral load in CSF, but this is unknown for the chronic stage.Association between these manifestations and elevated viral load inCSF could represent a therapeutic escape with worse neurologicalprognosis. Direct HIV-1 infection should be included in the differentialdiagnosis of mononuclear meningitides in these patients, in whichcase, the therapeutic strategy should consider drugs with bettercentral nervous system (CNS) penetration.",

At thebeginning of the XXth century amidst turbulent times in Europe, wherepolitical conflicts were resolved with bullets and bombs, attacks wereusually perpetrated by highly charged anarchists. In this way perishedDon Carlos I, and the President Sidónio Pais of Portugal, Humberto Iof Italy, Jorge I of Greece, Nicolau II of Russia and paradigmatically,the Archduke Francisco Ferdinand of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,whose homicide in Sarajevo lead to the First World War.The death of a king constitutes, at all times, a phenomenon ofgrand social and political impact, particularly if it occurs in tragiccircumstances or if it threatens to compromise the course of history,as happened in the cases of D. Sebastião and D. Carlos I.Medicine has always given great attention to royal figures and themost reputable doctors of the kingdom were summoned if an illnessthreatened the integrity of the monarch.During the XIXth century and fruit of the advances which characterised the evolution of knowledge, the preoccupation that clinicianshad in discovering the causes of illness and death of royal figures isnotorious, a process which was important for the progress in scientificmethodology used. The practice of regularly embalming monarchs ofthe Bragança dynasty, together with the consequent necropsy study,left shrewd anatamo-clinical records of surprising accuracy.A retrospective study of illness and death in the royal family, aprocess accompanied by the most well-known faces of medicineat the time, offers an interesting panorama of the medical concepts of the epoch.On the 100th anniversary of regicide, which ended the life of KingD.Carlos I and the Crown Prince D.Luís Filipe, precipitated the end ofthe monarchy in Portugal, conditioned decisively the course of nationalhistory, a small nosography of the last king of Bragança, based on ananalysis of the bibliographical material available is made.",

The objectives of this study were to calculateand compare the healing rate and the amputation rate for diabeticpatients with chronic lower-extremity ulcers not healed afterhyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), and for diabetic patients withchronic lower-limb ulcers not treated with HBOT.Research design and methods: 66 diabetic patients with chroniclower-extremity ulcers, Wagner grades II-IV, not healed despitefull standard treatment were included. 34 patients received HBOT(HBOT group). 15 did not improve (HBOT failure group) and 19improved with this adjunctive therapy (HBOT improved group). 32patients did not receive HBOT (control group).HBOT consisted of pure oxygen inhalation, during 90 minutes,through a facial mask in a semi-closed circuit, inside a multi-placechamber pressurized with air at 2.5 absolute atmospheres, oncea day, 5 days a week. Average of 54 individual HBOT sessions.The study was carried out over a mean 55 month period for thecontrol group, and over a mean 45 month period for the HBOTgroup, HBOT failure group and HBOT improved group. The patientswere assessed for wound healing and need for amputation.Results: The need for amputation was significantly less in theHBOT group (44.1%) and in the HBOT improved group (31.6%),when compared with that of the control group (84.4%). Themean healing rate of ulcers was significantly higher in the HBOTgroup (41.2%) and in the HBOT improved group (57.9%), whencompared with that of the control group (3.1%). The mean rateof “major” amputation was less in the HBOT group (23.5%), andin the HBOT improved and failure groups (21.1% and 26.7%,respectively), when compared with that of the control group(53.1%). The mean healing rate of ulcers was higher, but notstatistically significant, in the HBOT failure group (20%), whencompared with that of the control group (3.1%).Conclusions: The outcome of chronic diabetic lower-extremityulcers non-healed after HBOT was significantly better, whencompared with that of the non-HBOT treated diabetic lower-limbulcers, over a mean follow-up period of about 4 years.",

It arises within the bone marrow ofthe vertebral body, causing pain and neurologic symptoms due tobone destruction with fracture and collapse, visible on imagiologicstudies as osteolytic lesions usually associated with adjacent softtissue masses. The duration of symptomatology can be of severalyears before diagnosis, although clinical deterioration may be rapidand severe, with acute neurologic compression, radiculopathy,myelopathy and paraplegia, leading to the necessity of emergencysurgery. The prognosis after total excision and spinal stabilizationis generally excellent, as patients with solitary amyloidoma haveno known risk of development of multiple myeloma or systemicamyloidosis. The authors report the case of a patient with solitaryamyloidoma of the lumbar spine who unfortunately had a dismaloutcome, due to acute nosocomial pneumonia and sepsis byAcinetobacter baumanii and extended-spectrum β-lactamaseEscherichia coli occurring after open spinal biopsy.",

The world of patients with myocardialnecrosis now diagnosed is much larger and we need to study the evolution of this new entity.Objectives: The present study aimed to determine the influence ofelevated CK and CKMB levels in acute coronary syndromes with elevatedtroponin levels in patients presenting without ST-segment elevation, interms of clinical characteristics, evolution and prognosis.Methods: For 8 months, we studied sequentially all new admissionsof patients with ACS – NSTEMI with elevated troponin levels in ourIntensive Care Unit. We compared the population with a CK and CK-MBpathologically elevated level (both: CK level more then twice its normalmaximal level and a CKMB level greater than10% of CK level) with thegroup of patients with no elevation of these markers. Patients withelevation of only one parameter (CK or CK-MB) were included in thesecond group. The two groups were compared in terms of risk factors,previous history, clinical and angiographical characteristics and evolution at 30 days and 6 months.Results: From the 75 patients with ACS-NSTEMI (52 men), with themean age of 68.4 +-10.4 years, 43 (57%) had elevated CK and CKMBlevels and the other 32 had elevated troponin levels without elevation of CK and CKMB levels.Comparing the two groups, they were similar in terms of age, gender,cardiovascular risk factors, but those without CK elevation levels hadmore frequently a previous myocardial infarction (31 versus 19, p<0.05).The coronary morphology was not different, and the clinical evolutionwas similar, at 30 days and after 6 months. There was no significantdifference in terms of re-infarction, need for revascularization and coronary mortality. However, there was a significantly positive correlation between previous myocardial infarction and the total cardiovascular mortality (0.43, p<0.01).Conclusions: ACS-NSTE with elevated troponin level is a new entitywith a similar evolution to the previously described non-Q wave infarction.The prognosis is the same whether or not there is an elevation of CKand CKMB levels.In our study, we verified that ACS – NSTEMI without elevated CKand CKMB levels presented more frequently in patients with previousinfarction (p<0.05), and there was a positive correlation with total cardiovascular mortality at 6 months (p<0.01) in this group of patients.",

There is a higher prevalence with increasing age,affecting 2 to 7% of the elderly. If mild to moderate, it is welltolerated and usually asymptomatic. When severe, it is associatedwith high morbidity and mortality.Conventionally, aortic stenosis is considered a degenerativeprocess, in which damage to the valve has occurred due to timeand usage. However, only few elderly patients have aortic stenosis, even in bicuspid valves. Beyond the degenerative processwhich develops with age, other factors seem to be involved in the development of the disease.Risk-benefit analysis favours an early surgical intervention,bearing in mind the excellent surgical technique involved andconsequent low risk associated with valvular substitution.",

Twenty-three patients had a favourable evolution and constituted the control group; 20 patients presented complications (9 of which were vascular) and were classified in 2 sub-groups based onserum liver parameters: hepatocellular (aminotransferase elevations)and cholestatic (serum elevation of gama-glutamyl transpeptidaseand bilirubin). The following parameters were evaluated: age, gender, hospitalization and mechanical ventilation duration, APACHE II and SAPS II scores. The initial serum values of several biochemicalparameters were registered and compared when an increase wasfound (1.5 - 2 times the prior value).Results: The patients with complications were predominantly female (p=0.047), presented longer hospitalization time (p<0.001) andhad higher SAPS II scores (p<0.001). The initial lactate values werehigher in the complicated group (9.4 versus 6.7 mmol/L, p=0.0046).Vascular complications correlated with a hepatocellular pattern. A1.5 fold increase in lactate correlated with any complication and a2-fold increase with hepatocellular complications. Using multivariateanalysis, this variation in serum lactate was independently related tooccurrence of any complication (CI 1.18-1.64, p=0.003).Conclusions: Complicated post-OLT patients presented a higherinitial lactate value. Post-operative complications in the ICU correlated with 1.5-fold increase in serum lactate, while a 2-fold increasecorrelated with hepatocellular complications, especially those ofvascular origin. Serum lactate may be a useful monitoring tool ofcomplications in OLT patients in the ICU",

Up to 25% of patientsadmitted in hospitals are catheterized, of which, a high percentage are not justified. Catheter associated urinary tract infection(CAUTI) is the most common nosocomial infection documented, accounting for more than 40% of the total.Almost all patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward inour hospital, pass through the Emergency Department, wherethey stay until there is a bed available. Therefore, a high numberof patients have an IUTC at the time of medical ward admission.With this study we pretended to analyse the incidence of CAUTIin patients catheterized after hospital admission.Material and methods: Over a seven month time period, all thepatients admitted to the medical ward with an IUTC, were includedin the study. The urinary catheter was left in situ in those whohad a clear indication. If no need for catheterisation was found,a urine sample was collected for culture, and the IUTC removed.Patients admitted with the diagnosis of urinary tract infection were excluded.In the study population we studied the motive stated for catheterization, the sex/age distribution, the percentage of positiveurine cultures and the pathogens involved.Results: During this study, 15% (n=60) of the admitted patientshad an IUTC. The reason stated for catheterization was to measure urinary output in 66.7% of the patients, urinary retentionin 10% and no justification determined in 21.7% of the cases.In the studied population 93.3% (n=56) had no indication tomaintain the IUTC. The results of the urine culture performed inthese patients were positive in 23.2% (n=13), all with a IUTC inplace for more than 3 days. Of those who had a negative urineculture result (n=40), 65% had already been medicated with abroad spectrum antibiotic for more then 48 hours; this fact couldunderestimate the number of CAUTI.",

Stooloccult blood was positive in three samples. A repeat upper gastro-duodenal endoscopy and colonoscopy were negative. Bariumradiographic studies did not show images suggestive of tumouror infiltrative injury. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound showed animage compatible with an intra-abdominal heterogeneous mass.CT scan revealed a mass in the right lower abdominal, probablyan ileal lesion, with 6 cm of longitudinal diameter suggestiveof a tumour; a small amount of ascites but without evidence oflymph node involvement in the main abdominal and pelvic chains.She underwent a segmental enterectomy and appendicectomy.Histological examination showed malignant GastrointestinalStromal Tumour (GIST) with signs of muscular differentiation,positive C-Kit.

It also could be used to quantify and evaluate thecauses of inappropriate use of hospital resources.Objective: Evaluate the appropriateness of hospital admissions ofpatients admitted in a department of Internal Medicine during the yearof 2004, using the prospective version of the AEP.Method: Prospective and random study of the patients admittedin an Internal Medicine department during the year of 2004. Weanalyzed demographic, clinical (readmissions, co-morbidility andmortality) and administration parameters (hospitalization durationand appropriateness of hospital admission using the AEP, including causes of inappropriateness).Results: 72 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria with an averageage of 70.6 years. 42% were readmissions. The average hospital staywas 7.2 days. Mortality rate was 11.3%. 20.8% of the admissionswere considered inappropriate because they did not fulfill any AEPcriteria. The most common reason for inappropriate admission wasto perform diagnostic exams or treatments that could have beendone on an outpatient basis (53.3%).The most common criteria ofappropriateness was the need for intravenous therapy (87%), followedby the need for assisted ventilation (12.3%).Conclusions: The AEP allows us to evaluate the appropriatenessof hospital admissions in a Health Unit, enabling better utilization ofresources. A 20,8% rate of inappropriate admissions was recorded,similar to that found in other studies. The creation of a structure thatimproves the study of outpatient utilization could decrease inappropriateness of inpatient admissions.",

The majority of the physicians (90.2%) say they prescribe generic drugs but less thanhalf (45%) of these authorize substitution. It seems there is norelation between knowledge and prescription habits. The lack ofconfidence in the quality of generic drugs was the biggest obstacle concerning generic prescription.Conclusions: The data collected suggests that knowledge is notthe only factor that influences prescribing habits.

Several trials have proved a significant reduction inthe risk of stroke with anticoagulation (AC). New guidelines havesuggested AC for at least three weeks after cardioversion andlong term AC for patients older than 75 years with AF, as well asthose with risk factors for a thromboembolic event. Long-termAC in the community is safe and effective, even in the elderly.However, some physicians avoid prescribing AC.Objectives: Determine the prevalence of AF in patients attendingthe Internal Medicine Department of Fernando Fonseca Hospital,over the last 9 years; study the prevalence of stroke in thesepatients; determine the use of AC at discharge of patients with AF in 2004.Design: retrospective, event driven clinical database analysis.Results: In 9 years AF was found in 6.7% (927/13800) ofpatients. In 2004, 122 patients with AF were hospitalised and17.2% had cerebrovascular disease. AC on discharge was notedin only 22.2% of these patients.Conclusions: Even though it has been proved that AC reducesthe risk of stroke in patients with AF, in general practice the numberof patients anticoagulated is small. We must change this attitudein order to reduce the morbility and mortality associated to stroke,the leading cause of death in our country.",

Despite the absence of respiratory, cardiac, pulmonary or genito-urinary complaints, the initialanalytical assessment detected leukocytosis, thrombocytosis,normocytic normochromic anaemia and discrete renal failure. Thepatient was admitted to clarify the clinical picture and, if possible,to exclude underlying systemic disease.The diagnosis was found to be pyoderma gangrenosum associated with systemic vasculitis, probably Wegener’s granulomatosis.Early haemodialysis was necessary due to rapid and progressiverenal dysfunction. Nevertheless, therapy with corticosteroids andimmunosuppressants markedly improved skin lesions and renal function was restored.",

            "resumo": "AbstractAngioedema, a rare potentially severe disease, is characterized byrecurrent, circumscribed, solitary or multiple subcutaneous andmucosal swelling, involving the extremities, face, larynx and bowelwall. Bradykinin appears to be the main mediator of episodes.Angioedema is due to hereditary or acquired varieties of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency, each one comprising two types.In type 1 hereditary angioedema both C1INH protein level andfunction in plasma are decreased; whereas in type 2 hereditaryangioedema the C1INH level is normal or elevated, but C1INHfunction is decreased due to synthesis of dysfunctional C1INH. Intype 1 acquired angioedema there is depressed functional C1INHactivity, which is frequently associated with lymphoproliferativedisorders, whereas in type 2 acquired angioedema there is thepresence of anti-C1INH autoantibodies, often monoclonal, butwithout proven associated malignant disease. The attacks arecaused by several conditions. Based on a case of atypical acquired angioedema in a 49-year old man, responding favourably tocinnarizine and alcohol abstinence, the authors provide a concisereview of both types of angioedema, portending to pathogenicmechanisms, aetiology of attacks, clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis of both types of angioedema by quantifi cationof the C1 complement fraction determination, and the availabletherapeutic possibilities. Cinnarizine was prescribed due to presumed alcoholic liver disease. The clinically signifi cant improvement,was however not associated with concomitant good laboratoryresults, which is a relatively common occurrence.",

Our experience withNIV, in a Medical Intermediate-Care-Unit, over a 2-year period, is presented.Methods: A retrospective study of 66 patients who were treatedwith NIV, in the medical intermediate care unit (MICU) of the Garciade Orta Hospital, between January of 2001 and December 2002was performed. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were analysed.Results: Of 315 patients admitted to the MICU, 66 (20%) wereventilated non-invasively. Fifty-three percent were male and the meanage was 68 years. The main underlying conditions leading to NIV wereChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in 33 patients (50%),Pneumonia in 12 (18%), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) in 9 (14%),Post-Extubation-Syndrome (PES) in 6 (9%), Pickwick Disease in 4(6%), Kyphoscoliosis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) oneof each. The interface most commonly selected for NVI was the facemask (98%). After 48 hours of ventilation, signifi cant improvementof gas exchange was achieved in 61% of patients. Nine patientsdeteriorated clinically within this period, of whom, three needed tobe transferred to an intensive care unit for invasive ventilation and3 patients died. The mean length of stay in the MICU was 8.5 days,with a mean time of ventilation of 6.4 days ( 8.8 in CHF, 7 in PES, 6in COPD and 3.8 in Pneumonia). Invasive ventilation was necessaryin 11 patients, 4 with COPD, 3 with pneumonia, 2 with CHF, 1 withPickwick disease and 1 with PES. Nine percent of the patients, allsuffering from COPD, continued NIV after discharge on an outpatientbasis. The overall mortality of patients undergoing NIV was 21%.Conclusion and Discussion: NIV lead to signifi cant improvement ingas exchange in 61% of patients, within the fi rst 48 hours. Patientswith COPD, CHF and pneumonia had the highest benefi t, the latterrequiring the shortest time of ventilation.",

Themost prevalent were Rheumatoid Arthritis (1.181-2.305 patients),Lupus Erythematosus (708-1.395 patients) and Sjögren’s syndrome (320-665 patients). Therapy with anti-TNF agents is givento 135 patients, in 17 departments.Conclusions: In Portugal, internists follow a high number ofpatients with diverse autoimmune diseases, with a national distribution.",

Symptoms associated with HIV infection arecommon among seroconverts, but their non-specifi c nature andthe absence of a universally accepted defi nition, makes this amajor diagnostic challenge to health care providers. The authorspresent a case of a 32-year-old man, previously asymptomatic,admitted to our institution because of a mononucleosis-likeillness associated with diarrhoea, anorexia, fatigue and weightloss. The physical examination revealed fever, exsudative tonsillitis and pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy and liver enlargement.Laboratory studies indicated anaemia, lymphocytosis with atypicallymphocytes, high liver enzymes and LDH. He denied risk factorsfor HIV infection and had negative HIV serology 4 months priorto admission (blood donor testing). Despite the serology for EBVbeing positive, other serologies were asked for, including ELISAfor HIV, that confi rmed seroconversion. Colonoscopy and biopsiesrevealed an unspecifi c infl ammatory colitis, compatible with HIVcolitis. Antiretroviral therapy was started and after 4 weeks thepatient became asymptomatic, showing an increase in CD4+ cellcount and lower viral load.This case illustrates that even in patients without clear riskfactors for HIV infection, acute retroviral syndrome should beconsidered in the differential diagnosis of mononucleosis likesyndrome. Also a positive serology for EBV doesn’t exclude HIVinfection, and the suspicion of acute HIV illness should promptvirology analysis. Recognition of acute retroviral syndrome helpsus to limit transmission and probably to improve the prognosis ofthese patients with the possibility of early treatment.",

Valvular heart disease has assumed relevance and therewas a decrease of about 50% in drug abuse and HIV infectionamong patients with endocarditis. The sub-acute clinical presentation almost doubled and fever was the only manifestation thatremained unchanged during these years. The pathogens isolatedin blood cultures were different with an important reduction inMRSA. There was an increase in embolic cerebral complicationsand valvular complications with urgent need for surgery but significantly less mortality.Conclusion: in 2004 there was a signifi cant increase in infectious endocarditis with a change in the epidemiological, clinicaland microbiological patterns.

A subgroup of patients was prescribed a quantifiedcaloric restriction diet and data from this group was analysedseparately. We compared the mean weights of the total sampleobtained at the different evaluation periods and also for eachquartile of BMI; the lipid profile was compared at times 0 and 3 months.Results: Considering the whole sample, there was no significantweight variation at any interval considered. In the analysis by BMIquartiles, there was a statistically significant reduction from 3 to 6months (p=0.014) for the 4th quartile and a borderline significantreduction from 0 to 6 months for the 3rd quartile (p=0.05).In the first 3 months there was a statistically significant reduction of the total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.In the subgroup with individually adapted caloric restriction(n=8) there was, during the 1st 3 months, a weight reduction of2.18 Kg (p=0.033); in the same period, there was no statisticallysignificant variation of the lipid profile, probably due to the reduced sample size.Conclusion: The caloric restriction diet appears to be moreeffective in weight reduction than the usual lifestyle changes,which, in turn, have a favourable effect in the lipid profile, at least in the short term",

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction – Infectious pathology is one of the major causes of hospital admission in the Portuguese Medicine Services. Little data concerning the Portuguese reality is available and as such we are obliged at times to extrapolate from dataof other countries.Objectives – To determine the characteristics of infectious pathology in a Portuguese Medicine Service.Methods – A 6-month prospective systematic study in a University CentralHospital Medicine Service was carried out. All patients diagnosed with an infectious pathology, either on admission or after bacteriologic or serologic studies, were included in the study.Results – 228 patients met the study inclusion criteria, 59% were female and the average age was 69.9 years. The most frequent infections were respectively: respiratory (83) and urinary (46). The most frequent cultural examinations requiredwere blood culture for aerobes (194), urine cultures (187) and blood cultures foranaerobes (55). Percentage of positive identifi cation of infectious agents fromcultural examinations was: blood cultures for aerobes 10.3%; urine cultures25.7%; blood cultures for anaerobes 0% and sputum cultures 7.5%. In the 83patients diagnosed with a respiratory infection, 4 agents were isolated and oneserology were positive; the most frequent first line antibiotic therapy prescribedwas amoxycillin + clavulanic acid. In the 46 patients diagnosed with urinaryinfection, 51 agents were isolated, 31 were community acquired infections and20 nosocomial, predominantly Escherichia coli; the antibiotic sensitivity of themost frequent agents was determined; the most frequently prescribed fi rst lineantibiotic therapy was: cephradine (34.4%), amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (31.2%)and ciprofl oxacin (21.9%). First line antibiotic therapy used was changed in 27.2%of cases, the chief reason for alteration was a weak clinical response.Discussion – The study sample refl ects the reality of infectious disease pathology in a Portuguese Medical Service. The cultural examinations were requested inaccordance with the most frequent infectious diseases diagnosed. The profitabilityof the cultural examinations is the same as that found in international series, withthe exception of low infectious agent isolation in sputum cultures and anaerobesin blood cultures. The low number of isolates in respiratory infections does notallow for conclusions to be drawn. The rate of isolated agents in community andnosocomial urinary infections is similar to that reported in international data. Thisstudy showed that nitrofurantoin and cephradine were the best antibiotic agents forcommunity acquired urinary infections. The antibiotic therapy initially prescribedwas sufficient in most cases and was altered in about 25% of cases. This smallstudy represents some of the Portuguese reality and needs to be repeated, with alarger sample size, in order to draw firm conclusions and define the most adequatediagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for our reality.",

We designed the present study to evaluate the diagnostic potential and the therapeutic implications ofFBC in our ICU.Methods: Retrospective study of 95 FBC performed in a medico-surgical ICU. Indications, complication rate, endoscopic findings,additional studies performed during endoscopy, microbiologicstudies and their implication in antibiotherapy were evaluated.Findings: FBC was performed to evaluate pneumonia in 48cases, atelectasis in 24 and aspiration pneumonia in 21 cases.Identifi cation of an infectious agent in patients with pneumoniawas achieved in 32 cases resulting in an antibiotic regimenchange in 26 of them. Atelectasis was confirmed in 20 of the24 cases and aspiration pneumonia in only 3 cases. Mucosalinfl ammation and bronchial secretions were the most commonendoscopic findings and complication rate was low (transitory hypoxaemia in 10 cases).Conclusions: FBC is an endoscopic technique with a low rate ofcomplications and can be very useful in the study of pulmonarydisease in mechanically ventilated patients. The diagnostic andtherapeutic potential of FBC depends mostly on careful patient selection.",

On admission he had bite marksof moderate to severe gravity – the upper right limb was extremelyswollen, bruised and a haemorrhagic blister was present on thehand. Laboratory abnormalities suggesting acute renal injury,rhabdomyolisis and a consumptive coagulopathy were detected.The time period from snake-bite to treatment surpassed theperiod for anti-venom administration. The patient was treatedconservatively, showed clinical and laboratory improvementand was discharged from hospital ten days later. The differencebetween venomous snakes and inoffensive ones, as well as thecomplications of snake bite, treatment and indications for anti-venom are discussed.",

This fact is related to the highintake of soya in the normal asian diet. Presently, there is still aworrying lack of incontrovertible studies on the potential benefitsof phytoestrogens. Despite some recent advances achieved in thisarea there is still much to discover and explore.

            "resumo": "AbstractIn the last fi fty years the technical and scientifi c advances in fifty years the technical and scientific advances inthe area of medicine have introduced into clinical practice newconcepts of death, the diagnosis of which entails the productionof an elaborate list of evidence. The coexistence of various criteriaof death has been a controversial issue and subject to intensedebate.With discussions caught up in a stalemate of unclear conceptsand defi nitions, criteria of cerebral death were ratifi ed in mostcountries. Portugal adopted the death of the brain stem as thecriterion that has been applied since 1994.In this article, after putting the issue into historical perspective,the different defi nitions, criteria and testing of death are revised,mainly from an ethical point of view, in reference to the mainarguments put forth by advocates of each position.It is concluded that the inexistence of a single concept of death,together with the variation of criteria and testing methods are theevidence of the weakness of these defi nitions. Therefore clinicalsituations which are considered irreversible may no longer be so,depending on the scientifi c knowledge about the physiopathologyof diseases and therapeutic resources. In relation to the testsused in the diagnosis of death, it is concluded that performingthe apnea testing violates the most elementary rules employedto avoid irreversible brain damage in the treatment of patientswith intracranial hypertension.This makes a serious effort of therapeutic investigation intothe situations of coma and apnea mandatory at the same timeas an overall revision of testing methods in order to exclude the apnea testing.",

We comparedthe baseline characteristics of this group withthose of a sample of non-diabetic dyslipidemic patients treated differently.RESULTS: Three months after introducingmetformin, there was a 41,8% significant reduction of triglycerides (p=0.006), as well as a10.4% reduction of total cholesterol and a 5.9%raise of HDL cholesterol, which did not reachstatistical significance. LDL cholesterol did not vary significantely.The non-diabetic patients who were treatedwith metformin had lower mean HDL cholesterol and higher mean triglycerides than the other non-diabetics.CONCLUSION: Metformin emerges as a goodlipid-lowering drug in non-diabetic patients,particularly for patients with hypertriglyceridemia and other features of the metabolic syndrome.",

Mild elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone, normal levels of free thyroxine and free iodothyronine,associated to high levels of antithyroid antibodies, suggested chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.The association beteween Addison disease and autoimmune thyroid disease is the hallmark of Schmidt’s syndrome.

            "resumo": "AbstractIntroduction and Objectives – Coimbra´s University Hospital has a significant rate of Internal Transfers (IT). The authors analysed this parameter in the Internal Medicine department - Service II with the objective of evaluating thedepartments’ interface, namely resource utilisation and cooperation with other departments of the same Hospital.Material and methods – Amongst the admissions to the Internal Medicine department - Service II, the ones with a discharge date between the January 1st 2000 and December 31st 2001were selected. General indicators and indication for transfer were studied, particularly thesubgroups involving transfers to the IntensiveCare Unit (ICU) and Surgical procedures (Cir).The economic impact was quantified using relative weight methodology and financial determinations were based on the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG).Results – The number of IT episodes was 154 (6.3 % of the admissions to the Internal Medicine department - Service II). The mortality rate was 16.2 % and the average length of admission was27.7 days (higher than the Internal Medicinedepartment – Service II general average – 8.9 % and 8.7 days). The most significant IT targetdepartment from the Internal Medicine department – Service II was General Surgery (34 %). Onthe other hand, the ICU showed the highest rate of IT (4.8 %) to the Internal Medicine department– Service II. The subgroups involving Surgery (n=53; 34.4 %) and ICU (n=43; 27.9 %) showeda different profile from the overall number of transfers, namely the admission days attributed to the Internal Medicine department – Service II of the ICU patients (n=431) and urgent surgery (n=24). The impact on the DRG financial reimbursement in the IT group was significant.Conclusions – The authors outline some aspects of the analysis: 1. The IT correspondedto a more differentiated care group; 2. The importance of the post-ICU care group in theoverall results signalled the need for human and material resources adequate for proper care of these patients; 3. The existence of non-programmed surgery as a point of interest, namely the need for accurate identification inthe emergency room of the cases with surgicalindication; 4. The importance of the IT parameter in the model for financial evaluation of theIntegrated Responsibility Centres (IRC).",

Biographical data(sex and age) was also noted, as well as allinfectious episodes (on admission and nosocomial) and positive serologies for immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus andhepatitis C virus (HCV).For drug users the patterns of use were analysed, as well as complications during hospitalstay (especially the withdrawal syndrome).Results: During the year of 1998, 80 active drug users were admitted (5,8% of all admissions): 50men (7,1%) and 30 women (4,5%). The average age was 31 years in the TD group and 68,5 yearsin the control group.Among drug users 70% had positive serologyfor HIV and 48,7% for HCV (in the control groupthe prevalence was 2,4% and 1,2%, respectively).The mortality rate was respectively 11,3% and12,7% in TD group and control group, and thelength of stay was of 18,7 and 16 days.We identified 46 cases of tuberculosis (18,8%of the TD group and 2,4% of the control group),293 of pneumonia (28,7% and 21%) and 54 ofsoft tissues infection (27,5% and 1,5%, respectively). Only 4 cases of endocarditis (2 in eachgroup) and 6 of acute hepatitis (all in drug users) were found.In the TD group 33 episodes of withdrawalsyndrome were found (41,3% of this group). Regarding the discharges, 16 (20%) were againstmedical advice and in 4 of them the diagnosis was tuberculosis.In this population, 10 patients (12,5%) werehomeless (9 men and 1 woman) and 66 (82,5%) were injection drug users.Conclusions: During the year of 1998 activedrug users represented a significant part of thepopulation admitted to an Internal Medicineward. Although significantly younger, they hada mortality and lenght of stay similar to the other patients.Infections were the most frequent cause ofadmission in drug users. A high prevalence ofinfection by HIV, HCV and tuberculosis in this group was identified.Also relevant is the large number of dischargesagainst medical advice in this population, including some patients with potentially contagioussituations.",

The syndrome is highly polymorphic with clinical features rangingfrom mild symptoms to severe presentations.Severe forms of the diseases are only frequent in the homozygotic form (SS) and double heterozygotes, while sickle cell carriers are generally assymptomatic. Ocular manifestations are frequent in sickle cell anaemia and SC disease, occurring very rarely in heterozygotes, as stated.The authors describe a severe clinical case of sickle cell trait in a young female patient, withexceptional ocular manifestations (bilateral optic nevritis).",

It is included in thegroup of at least 41 unique genetic lysosomal storage diseases.It is caused by a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A, which leads to an accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids in most visceraltissues and fluids of the body which results in several clinical manifestations.Fabry-Anderson’s disease is characterized by acroparaesthesias, cutaneous angiokeratomas,hypohidrosis, corneal opacities, and cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervoussystems disturbances.Deposition of neutral glycosphingolipids in cardiac cells implies varied disturbances, with several symptoms, depending on patient’s sex and age.Some individuals develop a cardiac variant of Fabry-Anderson’s disease. About 3 to 6% ofasymptomatic men, with left ventricular hypertrophy, have the variant condition. Left ventricular hypertrophy can be used as a marker of disease severity.It is thought that 4 to 8% of patients with hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy,considered as idiopathic, have Fabry-Anderson’s disease. This disease ought to be considered and investigated (through biochemical study or an endomyocardial-biopsy specimen)as a possible cause of a cardiomyopathy.Fabry-Anderson’s disease has a high morbidity and death occurs in early adulthood, by thefourth or fifth decades of life, due to vascular disease of the kidney, heart or brain.",

            "resumo": "AbstractEssential hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction. This is caused by freeoxygen radicals that destroy nitric oxide, impairing its protective effects on the vascular wall.The endothelium has an autocrine/paracrine function, regulating the secretion of substancesthat control vascular tonus and structure. It produces relaxing factors, such as Nitric oxideand prostacycline, as well as constricting ones such as endothelin.By definition, endothelial dysfunction is a reversible functional alteration of the endothelial cell, resulting from deficient availability of nitric oxide.In hypertensive patients, endothelial dysfunction, although not directly responsible for the elevation of blood pressure, is a promoter for the atherosclerotic lesion and the main complications of hypertensive disease and thus becomesa goal for antihypertensive therapy.So far, the evidence about the prognostic value of endothelial dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, includinghypertension, is scarce. This makes it difficult to establish if pharmacological therapy of thisentity represents an adjuvant beneficial effect beyond that of blood pressure control, namelyon morbidity and mortality reduction in the hypertensive population.",

The study period was from 1999 to 2001. Clinical, laboratory, radiographic and microbiological data was collected fromthe records in clinical files. The adequacy of twomethods of assessing prognosis was also evaluated as well as the quality of physician care.Statistics were handled using SSPS 11.0.Results and Discussion: The majority of patients were male and the mean age found was 77.6±11.0 years. The most important adverse prognostic features present in the patients were:respiratory rate>30/minute, admission diastolic blood pressure<60mmHg, mental confusion,acidaemia and urea and creatinine plasmaticlevels above 50 and 1.2 mg/dL, respectively. Nopathogen was identified in 60% of the cases. Asignificant number of patients were categorised as having a bad prognosis by both methodsapplied, making them equally useful in the admission decision process. There was an agreement between the BTS and PORT scales. The initial approach lacked quality in the blood gasand aetiologic evaluation, in the delay in starting antibiotic therapy and in the low rates ofvaccination. The use of a pneumonia protocol is supported.",

The procedure was identified in the Hospital data base using the code 50.11 (CID-9).There were 610 liver biopsies registered during the study period. Two populations were evaluated in greater detail. One comprising the cases from 1991/1992 (n=66) – group A -, comparing it with the second group from 2000/2001(n=106) – group B. Several clinical and laboratorial parameters were analyzed in 48 patientsin group A (72, 7 %) and 85 in group B (80, 2 %).From the results obtained, the authors pointout and comment on the significant rise in programmed liver biopsies compared to those performed in inpatients, in the most recent group(B) and a larger number of cases that were discharged the same day of the procedure. The adventof interventional radiology was also noted in thispaper; the performance of CAT scan guided liver biopsies in 12 % of the episodes in group B,as compared to none in group A. Where indications were respected, there were less procedures for diagnosis / staging of alcoholic liver disease and more to evaluate isolated altered liver enzymes, liver masses and control of pre andpost hepatic transplant.

The diseasein humans is caused by only four of the sevenspecies of the bacteria: Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, Brucella suis and Brucella canis.Presently, its incidence is probably five times greater than the official figure, mostly due tomisdiagnosis of the milder forms and non-compliance with compulsory notification.Its geographic pattern coincides with the animal endemic distribution, being mostly an occupational disease, which involves mainly the 55-64 age-group, with a male predominance.The Brucella’ s pathogenic mechanisms are mostly due to its ability to survive in the intracellular environment, with smooth-lipopolyssacharide (LPL-S) having a fundamental role.Brucellosis is a systemic disease. Its presentation and the duration of the clinical pictureallow for its characterization in the acute, chronic and focalized forms.Wright’s sero-agglutination is the earliest means of serologic diagnosis in the acute form,with ELISA being the test of choice for diagnosing neurobrucellosis, chronic brucellosis andfor follow-up of active disease. Other serologictests appear as alternatives. The bacteriological culture of Brucella is frequently positive ifthe cultures remain in the appropriate mediumfor at least four weeks.Several treatment options are proposed, butthe association of doxicycline with streptomycin remains the most effective, with the lowest relapse rate.",

According tosome studies, the prevalence of microalbuminuria in the general population ranges from 3.8to 14.6%, being higher in diabetic and/or hypertensive individuals.Histopathological and experimental evidence suggest that dyslipidaemia can initiate andcontribute to the progression of nephropathy, with mechanisms similar to those involved inatherosclerosis; on the other hand, urinary albumin loss may lead to a rise in lipoprotein plasmatic levels.Lipid lowering therapy with statins has beenshown to reduce cardiovascular risk and also to improve endothelial function. Animal and invitro experiments have demonstrated beneficial effects of these drugs in several models ofnephropathy, including reductions in urinaryprotein excretion. Some studies conducted in patients with abnormal excretion of urinaryprotein support the hypothesis that reno-protective effects also occur in humans; however,the field is still open for investigation in thisarea, particularly the effect of statins in the reduction of microalbuminuria.",

Our goalwas to analyse the reasons for hospital admission and the impact that these patients represent in terms of bed occupation.Results: During the 15 months’ timeframe 4.5% of the hospitalisations in the department were due to patients with ESRD, 49.7% of whom underwent haemodialysis. In the haemodialysedpatients 26.0% started haemodialysis during hospitalisation and in 19.2% there was loss ofvascular access. The studied group’s mortality rate (MR) was 23.3% (Department MR: 8.9%)and the average length of stay (LOS) was 16.4days (Department LOS: 9.8 days). In the patients with loss of vascular access, the MR was33.3% and LOS was 24.7 days. In those who started haemodialysis in hospital, the MR was 21.1%and the LOS was 23.4 days. Among the factors contributing to the increased length of stay weredelays in the programming, execution and revision of vascular access by medical and surgical sub-specialities. In 71.4% of patients with loss of vascular access the delay in the construction of vascular access was greater than aweek and in 57.1% this delay exceeded two weeks. In the patients with inaugural haemodialysis, these values were 64.3% and 28.6%.Conclusion: Patients with ESRD on haemodialysis impose a substantial load on Internal Medicine Departments. There are difficulties in the articulation with sub-specialities, with negative clinical and financial consequences. Thesefaults need correction, namely through the establishment of multidisciplinary approach protocols.",

During infection andinflammation, a wide range of alterations in metabolism occur. These are part of the body´s reaction known as the acute phase response (APR). Infection and inflammation can also perturb lipoprotein metabolism and produce a widevariety of changes in the plasma concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins.Eicosanoids are a group of oxygenated fattyacids with diverse and potent biological activity, produced from the fatty acids. The varietyof eicosanoids products and their correspondingly diverse physiological effects have been well characterized, and probably represent the best-understood relationship between lipids and biological function. Consequently, attempts tomodulate the production of eicosanoids musttarget either the enzyme activities responsible for synthesizing eicosanoids or the concentration of fatty acids substrate entering biological system through the diet.",

Several second line therapies, includingimmunosuppression, have received attention in the international literature.We describe a case of a 36-year-old womanwith a 9-year history of ITP, refractory to corticosteroids and splenectomy, as well as to immunossupression with azathioprine for 2 years. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) wasused during the episodes of thrombocytopaenia with platelet levels below 10x109/L, with agood, yet transient response and an increasingnumber of hospital admissions (18 during 2 years). In view of the absence of a sustained response to the 1st and 2nd line therapeutic options and the transient response to IVIG, a 3rd lineregimen, described in the literature, of pulsedhigh doses of oral dexamethasone (40 mg/dayfor 4 days), with a 28 day interval, for 6 months, was started. After the last course and witha follow-up of 2 years, the platelet counts haveremained persistently above 100x109/L, without evidence of haemorrhage.This particular case provides additional evidence favouring the use of oral mega-doses ofdexamethasone as an effective and simple therapeutic option for refractory ITP, with favourable effects extended beyond the period of therapy.",

Nevertheless, farmers whofail to follow safety precautions, may suffer accidental intoxication via the skin or respiratorytract. Poisoning in these cases is associated with a better prognosis.The A.A. describe the case of a 66-year old malewho sprayed his lower limbs with a paraquatsolution. Soon afterwards, he noticed erythematous macules, that over the period of a week,evolved to papules and ulcers in the legs anddorsum of the feet. Two months after paraquat exposure he developed macules, papules andhaemorrhagic bullae, some of which progressed to necrosis, in the digits of the hands andfeet, associated with fever and a general senseof being unwell. Histology revealed a small vessel necrotising vasculitis. There was a markedimprovement with steroid therapy and the patient is asymptomatic at 24-months follow-up.After exclusion of other causes of small vessel necrotizing vasculitis and even though it wasnot possible to determine the presence of paraquat in the affected skin, the temporal relationship with the direct exposure to the product allows for the hypothesis that this is a case ofhypersensitivity vasculitis caused by paraquat.A literature search failed to reveal a previous report of such an association.",

The authors have retrospectively analyzed some post-discharge assessment parameters in an Internal Medicine Service.Material and Methods – Admissions to the Medicina II Service of the Coimbra University Hospital, whowere discharged, as registered on the DRG data-base, , during a 3 month period were selected. Thepatients’ course inside the institution in the following 6 months was studied. Demographic data,outpatient visits, emergency visits and readmissions were analyzed, as were mortality, principaldiagnosis, DRG and its relative weight.Results – 72.9% of all patients had at least one post-discharge contact (outpatient visit, emergency visit,readmission). There were 232 outpatient visits (54.2% of patients), 100 emergency visits (41.6%) and 86readmissions (41%); of the latter, the most frequent principal diagnosis was pneumonia (10,4%). Themortality rate was 10.4% (15 patients). Some factors influenced the results, like a relative weight over1.0 and age under 80, which influenced the number of patients with outpatient visits, as well as thediagnosis of pneumonia, which influenced the number of patients with emergency visits and mortality.Conclusions – This study shows a significant impact of the post-discharge care in the same institution, inits diverse sectors. The in-hospital mortality was probably the most important result, revealing thegeneral prognosis of our inpatients. The systematic review of post-discharge assessment parameters,including in-hospital mortality and readmissions is important to overcome the difficulties in today’sInternal Medicine Services. It is necessary, in these studies, to use comparable methods, like DRGs andcase-mix.",

She had a previous medicalhistory of epilepsy since childhood, chronic anaemia in adolescence, and giardiasis.As an inpatient, the following tests were positive: D-xylosis for malabsorptionsyndrome, duodenal biopsy suggestive but not diagnostic for coeliac sprue.Autoantibody tests were positive for anti-gliadin IgA and IgG, anti-reticulin and antiendomysium.She clinically and histologically improved on a gluten-free diet. The autoantibody titrealso diminished.A correlation is established between the obstetrical occurences and the circumstances inwhich the diagnosis was made.Coeliac sprue should be included in the work-up for diarrhoea in the adult, even in olderages. The diagnosis, once considered, is easy and cheap. It’s an example of newparadigms of Internal Medicine, as advances in laboratory diagnosis lead us toreappraise clinical reasoning, and reach new conclusions.",

The author’sobjective was to characterise patients discharged, from the José Luciano CastroHospital - Anadia, with the diagnosis of haemorrhagic stroke, with respect to evolutionand post-discharge planning.Patients and methodology – The clinical files of all patients admitted between 1994and 1999 for subarachnoid and intracerebral haemorrhagic events, according to thediagnosis-related groups (DRG) database (ICD-9, codes 430 and 431) wereretrospectively reviewed. The following data was recorded: age, sex, residential area,mortality, hospital length of stay, co-morbidities, transferrals and post-discharge socialplanning. This data was compared and correlated to the data on ischaemic stroke for thesame period.Results – There were 155 admissions for haemorrhagic stroke, corresponding to 148patients. The population was homogeneous where residential area was concerned andaccounted for 16.2% of all strokes. The average length of stay was 20.3 ± 14.1, longerin patients with infectious complications (28.3 ± 17.8 for pneumonia, 31.3 ± 12.8 forother infections) as well as for those with more than one comorbidity (32.0 ± 19.9). Theprevalence of prolonged hospitalisation was 6.5%. Complications during hospitalisationoccurred in 54.8% of the admissions, pneumonia being the most common complicationregistered (18 patients). The mortality rate was 18.1%, often early in the hospital stay(17.8% in the first day, 57.1% in the first six days) and mostly in the elderly. All theseindicators were worse in comparison to those recorded for ischaemic stroke. Ondischarge social worker’s help was needed in 67.5% of cases.Discussion – The seriousness of haemorrhagic stroke, obvious from the indicatorsconsidered (mortality, average length of stay, transferral and comorbidities) is greaterthan that of other strokes, and it affects younger populations. The need for post-discharge social planning in a large number of patients is also discussed. The significantweight of these indicators and the increased hospital resources expenditure in thesecases, raises the question as to whether reimbursement should be the same as that forischaemic stroke events, as all stroke pathology is coded similarly (DRG 14) “Specificcerebrovascular disorders, except TIA”",

He was admitted for study, and chest x-rays (CXR) showed thepresence of chest-wall lesions and a right pleural effusion. Laboratory analysis of thepleural aspirate revealed an empyema. Upper digestive endoscopy showed a fistula, withdrainage of purulent liquid. CXR and thoracic CT scan with oral contrast documented thepassage of contrast from the oesophagus into the pleural space, confirming the existence of a oesophago-pleural fistula.The patient underwent oesophageal exclusion surgery, with drainage and decortication ofthe right pleural space. Two months later oesophagectomy and gastric tube reconstructionwas performed. Two years after surgery a relapse of the empyema occurred, andthoracoplasty was necessary.

In 16 centres, 208 ambulatorypatients, 18-70 years old, were selected and classifiedaccording to the levels of risk defined by theguidelines of the European Atherosclerosis Societyvalid at the study time. Of the 191 who startedmedication, three abandoned treatment because ofadverse events.There were highly significant differences in lipidvalues between visit V2 (basal) and V3 (one monthafter 10 mg/day of atorvastatin). Total cholesterolwas reduced by 25.2%, LDL cholesterol by 32.2%,and triglycerides by 23.3% (p<0.001). In 17% of thepatients it was necessary to double the dose ofatorvastatin, in order to try to achieve the cholesterolgoals of the respective cardiovascular risk level, andcomparing to V3 levels, total cholesterol decreasedmore 10.0% and the LDL cholesterol more 13.3%.With the 10 mg dose, HDL cholesterol increased by35% (p=0.013) in patients with a basal level under35 mg/dl (n=14), and by 15% (p<0.001) in all patientswith a basal level under 40 mg/dl (n=37).This study, in Portuguese dyslipidaemic patients,confirmed the excellent efficacy and tolerability ofatorvastatin in decreasing LDL cholesterol levelsand in increasing low HDL cholesterol levels.",

Among non-hospitalised individuals, hyper-natraemia mainly occurs in elderly people, as a result of infection-related dehydration. In hospitalised patients, it appears when water is given erroneously to individuals whose state o consciousness is altered or are cannot freely access water. As a response to hypernatraemia, the brain undergoes a series of mechanisms to avoid neuronal shrinkage. The rapid up-take of electrolytes is followed by a slower phase of accumulation of organic osmolytes. Hypernatraemia is treated with infusion of liquids at a rate dictated by the rate of removal of the referred solutes from the brain. The mortality rate varies between 40 and 60%.",

            "resumo": "Abstractystemic sclerosis is a relatively rare disease, characterized by variable degrees of fibrosis within the skin and internal organs. There are two major subsets, limited and diffuse systemic sclerosis, which are differentiated primarily by the extent of skin involvement, and are characterized by different disease evolution and prognosis. Concepts regarding this disease have changed over the years. Uniform concepts are extremely important, as they will allow comparison of groups of patients from different centres, and therefore facilitate a better knowledge of this disease.Although systemic sclerosis was first described in the 18th century and is recognized as a multi-systemic disease since the 19th century (before, cutaneous sclerosis – scleroderma – was considered as one disease and other diseases, such as gastrointestinal, pulmonary, etc., were considered to be associated with it), its’ aetiology remains unknown and its’ pathogenesis not entirely understood. This has resulted in the non-existence of a specific and therefore curative treatment. Despite this, advances have been made regarding the treatment of several of the disease manifestations. The discovery that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for instance are effective in the treatment of sclero-derma renal crisis, the most fatal complication of systemic sclerosis up till then. Such new advances have allowed improvement in the quality of life and the rate of survival of these patients. In this article, the new perspectives of treatment of this disease and its’ different aspects are discussed.",

The authors describe fourpatients from the Republic of Cabo Verde, who presented with prolonged fever, weight loss, tender hepatomegaly,anaemia, hypereosinophilia, an erytrocyte sedimentationrate over 100, low albumin, hypergammaglobulinemia, highalkaline phosphatase and high gama-GT. Fasciola sp. eggswere found in the faeces together with positive serology.Abdominal CT scans revealed hepatomegaly with multiplefocal liver lesions not enhanced by contrast and in one ofthe cases described as “tracking” lesions. The patients weretreated with triclabendazole, approved only for veterinaryuse, but already successfully used in humans without side effects in Europe and Latin America.This treatment was well tolerated and resulted in a goodclinical, laboratory and radiological response. The authorspropose that triclabendazole should be the treatment ofchoice in hepatic fascioliasis especially in the light of theknown therapeutic failures and multiple side-effects associated with the use of bithionol, emetine, albendazoleand praziquantel, the recommended treatment to date of fascioliasis.",

It has been shown topositively diagnose cerebral infarction and can contributeto determine the eligibility of the patient for fibrinolysis.It is important that all doctors responsible for the initialapproach of stroke patients are able to recognise early CT signs of acute ischaemic stroke.Ischaemia results in changes in cerebral tissue densitywhich are present on a CT scan taken during the first 4hours after a stroke. This has been demonstrated in animal and human studies.Ischaemic oedema, the hyper-dense artery sign and cerebral oedema are early CT signs, that are potentially visible inthe first hours after ischaemic stroke. Each of this signs hasits own meaning and implications, which can help decidewhether a patient is eligible or not for fibrinolysis.Images of each of the above mentioned signs are presented.",

Apan from the responsibility of in-patient care, the Internal Medicine specialist faces many other responsibilities. If the communication lines between the Hospital and the Health Centre are not well organised, the Internal Medicine specialist will be unable to act as the main hospital representative at the community level, as the link with the patient's doctor, and as such, the Internal Medicine out-patient appointment will not be beneficial. The main problems are due to Jack of organisation and/or Jack of physical and human resources in the out-patient clinic. This work attempts to identify the essential functional requirements for quality care which should be planned according to the population it serves and should follow well-defined regulations and objectives. One of the most important roles should be the obligation to send a medical report, even if preliminary, to the patient's family doctor.",

A patient with otherwise unexplained spinal pain should be submitted to a careful clinicai, Jaboratory, radiologic and neurologic exam. Once the diagnosis is established, adequate intravenous antibiotic treatment must be given, for at Jeast four weeks, and in the presence of neurological defects, neurosurgical intervention is often indicated.We present two cases which illustrate specific aspects of diagnosis, clinical evolution and therapeutic problems, associated with this pathology.",

Methe­ moglobinemia causes tissue hypoxia, being responsible for chocolate colour type of cyanosis, and other progressive symptoms, including abnormalities of respiratory and cardiac function as the concentration of methemoglobin grow up.Etiology can be genetic or acquired. Acquired form is much more common, and there are a great number of oxidizing agents causing it, namely dn,gs. The most common genetic cause is deficiency of enzymatic system of cytochrome-b5reductase,from which we know three differentgenetic variationswith weak activity.Laboratory confirmation of methemoglobinemia requires co-oxymetry, but clinicai diagnosis is essential.Oxidizing  agents  besides  causing  methe­ moglobinemia can be responsible for some degree of hemolysis, mostly if there is concomitant deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, in which case it is better not to use methylene blue in the treatment of methemoglobinemia. ln high doses methylene blue is an oxidizing agent, causing induction of methemoglobin. If there is deficiency of the referred enzyme, the haemolytic action of methylene blue will happen with lower doses of the drug. Exchange transfusions are alternative therapy in serious cases.

There is presently a Jarge gap between what the molecular geneticists\npromise, (such promises are included in research projects under way or still in a blue-print stage) and what is really available for diagnosis and treatment. Bioethical issues aside, practitioners should be aware of the usefulness and limitations of genetic testing in clinicai practice, and the need for a well-defined set of rufes before requesting a given test. This includes a precise definition of the heredity pattern for each condition and the diagnostic and treatment alternatives suggested by each result. Practitioners should have working information about the tests currently offered, know the exact indications for each one, and be prepared for the issues eventually raised by the interpretation of expected results.New diagnostic molecular tests will be very helpful, especially when used judiciously. However, more than in any other medical field, it is necessary to know when and how to request these tests: their use should be included in a strict scheme of study and follow-up.",

In this article we aimed to study thenatural history of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, the different therapeutic approaches and the referencestrategies after discharge. In order to do so, aretrospective study was performed and 81 in-patientswith the diagnosis (primary or secondary) of alcoholwithdrawal syndrome were studied. The most frequentcomplications encountered were rhabdomyolysis (51%)and seizures (39%). The drugs most often usedtherapeutically were neuroleptics and benzodiazepines.After discharge, there was no patient referral or follow-up in half of the cases. We concluded that alcoholwithdrawal syndrome is a frequent diagnosis and thereis a need for the implementation of therapeuticprotocols and better follow-up after discharge, if wewant to change the natural history of this disease.",

The following parameters were assessed:demographic; quantity ingested and time fromingestion to hospital arrival; evolution and mortality;clinical manifestations and results of laboratorial testson and during admission; treatments instituted.Results: 37 cases were documented: 19 died(51.4%) after a mean time of 7 days, 18 survived(48,6%) after a mean follow up of 7.5 months. Theappearance of jaundice, leucocytosis, renal failureand hypoxaemia was significantly more frequent inthe patients who died. High values of lacticdehydrogenase and low values of carbon dioxideon admission were associated with worse prognosis.Among the various treatment modalities used,sodium sulphate, either isolated or associated withgastric lavage and activated charcoal, had astatistically significant favourable effect on survival(used in 31% of the deceased and 55% of survivors).Haemocarboperfusion was used more frequently inthe group of deceased patients (58% against 33%).Other dialysis techniques were used infrequently.Conclusions: The best prognostic indicator(paraquatemia) was not available in our series.Mortality correlates with the quantity of poisoningested, resulting acutely from multi-organ failure,or from late respiratory failure. Adsorbents andcathartics are still the only confirmed prognosticmodifiers. Advantages of other therapeutic modalities, such as dialytic techniques, were notfound in this study.",

In general, the former is an acutecomplication (acute tubular necrosis andglomerulonephritis), while malariae infection can beassociated with a chronic progressive syndrome(nephrotic syndrome with evolution to chronic renal failure).It appears that acute renal failure (ARF) infalciparum malariae cases is not directly caused bythe parasite itself, but is the result of interaction ofmechanical, immunological, and humoralcomponents. Risk factors for the development ofrenal failure include hyper-parasitaemia, shock andsevere intravascular haemolysis. Delayed treatmentof malaria and late or inadequate correction ofvolume depletion, are probable contributing factorsin some cases. The reversibility of the renal lesionhas been well shown, by the reduction in mortalityachieved by introducing peritoneal or hemodialysis,as well as following the parenteral administration ofquinine. In severe cases associated with “black waterfever” a fatal outcome is almost inevitable.A mild acute glomerulonephrits has beendocumented in many patients with acute falciparum malaria.The nephrotic syndrome may develop in patients,particularly children with repeated plasmodiummalariae infections.

            "resumo": "AbstractHyponatraemia is the most common electrolytedisturbance in hospitalised patients and it reflects awater balance disturbance with associated hypo-osmolality. There are several associated conditions:fluid losses, oedematous states (heart failure, hepaticcirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome), syndrome ofinappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion(SIADH), primary polydipsia and endocrinediseases. Initial evaluations to reach an aetiologicdiagnosis should include: measurement of plasmaticand urinary osmolality, the plasma concentration ofsodium, and clinical assessment of the extracellularcompartment. Two basic principles are involved inthe treatment of hyponatraemia: raising plasmasodium concentration at a safe rate and treating theunderlying cause. However, treatment of thisdisorder also requires balancing the risks ofhypotonicity against those of therapy, in order toavoid central osmotic demyelination. A new class ofpromising agents, the vasopressin receptorantagonists, has been described, and it seemsreasonable to expect improvement in the treatmentof hyponatraemia associated with heart failure,hepatic cirrhosis and SIADH.This article focuses on the causes, differentialdiagnosis and treatment of this electrolyte disorder.",

The dichotomy between GeneralInternal Medicine and its Sub – Specialities, as wellas the relation between the General Internist andthe Specialist is elaborated. Special emphasis is givento the priority need of future investment in PrimaryCare and in the formation of Generalists (Internists,Paediatricians and Family Physicians who are inshort supply in our country) on which,unquestionably, our Health System must be based.Also attention is drawn to the undesirable numberof General Physicians without suitable formationand institutional employment. A plan to differenciateInternal Medicine as a Medical Speciality, basedon a common period of 3 years, is presented andjustified. The division of General Internal Medicineinto three different but complementary fields issuggested: Primary Care Internist, HospitalSpecialist and Emergency Specialist, adapting therecognised American and German models. The finalconclusions emphasise the need to face theseproblems with determination and coherence, puttingpatients suffering and the way Health System works,as our top priority.",

The main conclusion to be drawn is that albeit new and important drugs are being introduced, there is no need to establish new principies governing therapy. Drug research has experienced in the Jast decadenew and important developments, as exemplified by its interdisciplinary scope, use of new technologies (genetics, genomics, computer science, combinatory chemistry, etc.), search for more selective and specific drugs, early intervention oi clinicians in the experimental planning, growing attention given to orphan diseases and those predominating in poor developping countries. Even the notion oi remedy or drug has changed, now being extended to chemical entities which alter physiological mechanisms (for exemple, contraceptives, sildenafil, arcabose, orlistat, etc.)None of these alterations, novelties and evolutions justifies an adoption of new therapeutic norms, the classical principles of doing no harm, benefiting the patient and giving priority to his or her good continuing to be of paramount importance. Used in this way, drugs will continue to be what Galen called them, \"deorum quasi manus sunt\".",

This paper aims to summarise some of the major changes occurred at European levei. However their process has not been homogeneous in all European countries, since the current Internal Medicine practice varies from one country to the next. There are few studies which analyse these differences. On the basis of several meetings promoted by the European Federation of Internal Medicine, the authors have inquired into the dissimilarities and tried to explain them. The paper also deals with the different Internal Medicine training programmes and the structural differences existing between the national health systems all over Europe.The last section of this paper outlines the best aspects of the Internal Medicine departments across Europe.Europe is a socio-political reality that is built upon the characteristics of its member countries, some of which require homogenisation.

The patient had received ovulation induction medication ten previously.Despite adequate surgery and multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy, metastatic para-aortic lymph nades, were detected 10 months after operation. Second line chemotherapy and radiotherapy failed to halt tumor progression, and the patient died 18 months post­ surgery . This rare and agressive type of tumour must be differentiated from other ovarian tumours , namely germ-cell tumours and lymphoma, because prognosis and therapeutic management are different. The origin of this tumour is unknown. Optimal post- surgery treatment (multiagent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or combined therapy), in the adjuvant setting or in recurrent disease, is not yet defined.",

Examine hypertension evolution six months after stroke / AIT.Definition: prospective study in 470 patients with sufficient protocolled medical information, with stroke or TIA admitted to an Internai Medicine department (Hospital S. José, Lisbon).Methods: medical examination was performed and ali patients had different complementary exams done, including a computerised tomography scan of the brain.Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure than 160 mmHg andlor diastolic blood pressure than 95 mmHg on at least two different occasions or any previous treatment with antihypertensive drugs.We individualised three subtypes of stroke: IH, IS and TIA. For each subtypewe evaluated: age, sex history of hypertension, classification of hypertension by blood pressure levei, control profile of hypertension during acute stoke, blood pressure levei six months after stroke.Results : in the entire population (N = 470) hypertension was more prevalent in IH {91.5%) than in IS {69.5%} or TIA {61.3%}. Global prevalence of hypertension is high {67.2%}, 68% of patients did not have controlled hypertension during acute stroke.The average duration of hypertension before stroke is 104 months.Hypertension began before and at a higher levei of blood pressure in IH than in IS.Six months after acute stroke, hypertension was no controlled in 66.5% of patients.Conclusions: The prevalence of HTA in the 470 patients with the first AVC I TIA was high and theHTA was no controlled in the stroke. Risk of stroke was clearly related to eficiency of blood pressure control with treatment.Hypertension was very frequent and had a much greater impact in risk of IH.",

Laboratory findings, which included a skin biopsy, established the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. The aetiology and pathogenesis of this disease remain unknown. Both children and adults can be afflicted with dermatomyositis. To diagnose a Primary Idiopathic Dermatomyositis an associated connective tissue disorder or a malignancy must be excluded. Dermatomyositis not uncommonly presents solely with  cutaneous  manifestations. The recently proposed concept of amyopathic dermatomyositis has been the source of much controversy. ln reference to this case some considerations regarding clinicai features, treatment and prognosis are made.",

Recently, new data has emerged concerning its diagnosis and therapy.Objectives: The authors reviewed the state of the art of this pathology and incorporated the new data in  a practical approach  to the diagnosis  and treatment, in the emergency room and ward.Results and Conclusions: The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency room should start with the clinicai picture, which is extremely sensitive, although not specific. The confirmation of the diagnosis rests on blood and radiological tests, some of which are possible to perform in the emergency room, but often are only completed on the ward. Anticoagulation should start immediately, in the emergency room and before confirmation of the diagnosis. Thrombolysis, when indicated, diminishes mortality and morbidity.",

Both decreased perfusion and hypoxia caused a rapid elevation of aminotransferases and lactic dehydrogenase; the former correlated with a reduced prothrombin ratio.Prothrombin ratio was the only parameter which correlated with mortality.",

They ali showed laboratory alterations: a persistently raised serum calcium, increased leveis of parathyroid hormone and very similar imaging findings.The first two cases of this communication, document ways in which parathyroid carcinoma can present itself: 1) An emergency, if not dramatic, presentation in the first case, which was very difficult to treat (AJC, 64 years old female); and 2) Bone changes in the second case (DRS, 18 year old male), in which there was evidence of parathyroid gland capsule invasion which was surgically excised). Both patients had pathological bone fractures with pseudo-tumoral aspects and were transferred from the Orthopaedic Department - Bone Tumours Section- to our department.The third case involved a patient (MCPM, aged 67) who died the day before surgery, who had nodules on the ultrasound, probably of the parathyroid gland, but without pathological confirmation.The three patients had clinicai manifestations of hypercalcaemia, as well as very high serum calcium values (maximum values were 15.1, 18.6 and 22.4 mgldl) and PTH values more than ten times the upper limit of normal (1956 pglml, 805 pglml e 15 nglml, with upper limits of normality of 72 pglml, 55 pglml e 1.4 nglml, respectively).We highlight the importance of considering parathyroid carcinoma in the aetiology of hyper­ parathyroidism, since it has a substantial morbidity and mortality, and the prognosis is dependent on timely diagnosis and surgical intervention.",

Plasma­ pheresis (PF) and recently Intravenous Immuno­ globulin (IvIG) are the therapies of choice, resulting in significant clinicai improvement.ln this retrospective study, 46 patients with a diagnosis of GBS were analysed. Three groups of patients were considered. One (18 patients) treated with PF, a second one (13 patients) with IvIG anda third one (15 patients) received only the best medical treatment (MT).According to the funcional score, 38,4% of patients improved one or mores grades with PF, 61,5% with IvIG and 46,6% with MT.Three patients died, one in the PF group and the others two in the MT group and none in the IvIG. A significant percentage of patients treated with IvIG was discharged with minor signs and symptoms (69,2%), versus 22,2% and 33,3% in the PF and MT groups respectively.This study shows a high favourable response to IvIG. The worst results in the PF group might have been due to a more severe disease and a higher incidence of bad prognostic factors, at the beginning of the treatment.",

It is an infection of the endocardium and the heart valves (specially abnormal and susceptible cardiac structures), most often resulting from bacteremia. Infective endocarditis has a broad clinical picture, with systemic and multiorgan impairment. Major complaints are fever and others systemic symptoms such as night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, embolic manifestations (hematuria, backache, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Osler 's nodes, Janeway lesions or Central Nervous System embolization) and a cardiac murmur. Definite diagnosis is often delayed due to this non specific manifestations. The índex of suspicion of Infective Endocarditis, therefore, must be high in order to prevent potentially fatal complications.The authors report five cases of infective endocarditis admitted to our Internal Medicine Department with fever of unknown origin, stressing the importance of Echocardiography, specially Transesophageal Echocardiography, for definite diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic strategy.",

HGV infection has not yet been studied in Portugal.Aims: Study of the prevalence and clinicai significance of HGV infection in carriers of HBV or HCV, in patients with chronic hepatitis of unknown aetiology, and in those belonging to some risk groups. Patients and methods: HGV-RNA was determined in serum of 118 patients (75 M, 43 F): 18 with chronic hepatitis C (group I); 17 alcoholics with anti-HCV (group II); 36 chronic haemodialysis patients (group III), 16 of them with chronic hepatitis C (IIIA) and 20 without anti-HCV or HBsAg (IIIB); 17 renal transplant recipients with HCV infection (group IV); 18 chronic hepatitis B patients (group V); 10 with chronic hepatitis with unknown aetiology (group VI); 2 women with autoimmune hepatitis.). Eleven patients {7 of group I and 4 of group II) were drug addicts. HGV-RNA was assessed by RT-PCR, with primers of the 5'NC and NS5a regions, labelled with digoxigenine. Liver histology was assesssed and correlated with HGV infection in 56 chronic hepatitis C patients and in those belonging to groups V, VI and VII.Results: We found HGV-RNA in 20 patients: 3/18 (16.7%); 2/17 (11.8%) of group II; 5/36 (13.9%) of group III, 2/16 (12.5%) of IIIA and 3/20 (15%) of IIIB; 6/17 (35.3%) of the group IV; 4/11 drug addicts (36.4%); none of the patients with cryptogenic or autoimmune hepatitis. Liver histopathology in 9 patients HCV + HGV infections showed minimal activity in 4 and mild in 5; no fibrosis in 3, portal in 6; in 4 HBV +HGV, mild activity and no fibrosis in 1, severe activity and bridging fibrosis in 3 (also alcoholics). The 3 haemodialysed with only HGV infection had normal ALT and GGT.Conclusions: The prevalence of HGV infection was quite similar in most of the studied groups (12.5 to 22%); the exceptions were drug addicts (36.4%), renal transplant patients (35,3%) and those with chronic non-BC hepatitis (0%). Our data suggest little or no pathogenicity of HGV. However, the severity of liver disease in alcoholics with HGV and HBV infections is a remarkable finding. Future studies on the relationship between this and other hepatitis vírus are warranted.",

But, althoug uncommon, the diferencial diagnosis of primary liver lymphoma should be entertained when patients present with solitary or multiple (our patient) liver defects, particularly when alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen levels are normal.",

However, occasionally, they present with symptoms among wich, haematologic disorders appear in a very few cases.The authors report a case of splenic hamartoma in a 44-year-old woman with pancytopenia. Prolonged enhancement on post-contrast CT and MR imaging was a useful finding in differentiation of splenic hamartoma from malignant lesions of the spleen. Hamartomas should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of splenic tumors. Splenectomy, is indicated in cases where malignancy cannot be excluded and in cases of associated haematologic disorders. The haematologic abnormalities, disapeared after removal of the spleen.By review of the literature, they are less than two tens of well-documented cases of symptomatic splenic hamartomas associated with haematologic disorders.",

It aims to assess the nutritional status of patients aged 65 years or older, admitted to the general me­dical ward of a Central Hospital.Methodology: The triceps skinfold thickness (TST) and mid­arm circumference were measured using the standard manner and the midarm muscle cir­cumference (MAMC) calculated using the re­ commended formula. The TST or the MAMC were considered diminished when below the 10thpercentile of the reference table, matched for age and sex. The albumin, transferrin, pre-al­bumin, retinol binding protein, haemoglobin, total number of lymphocytes and total cholesterol were also measured and compared to the hospital's laboratory reference values.Results: The percentage of undernourished patients, in accordance with the previously defined parameters, revealed a wide range of values, varying from 11,1 to 35,6 %, with respect to each of the anthropometric values measure · andfrom 30,6 to 88,6 % with respect to each of the laboratoty values.Discussion andconclusion: There is no single anthropometric measure­ ment or laboratory parameter, that is, in iso­lation, a good indicator of the nutritional status in an individual patient. There is a large disparity between the information given by each variable in relation to the nutritional status of an individual pattent. ln the elderly, bedri­dden pattent, who often has a serious inter­ current illness that leads to hospitalisation, there is an urgent needfor the development of a nutritional índex which could be used in daily clinical practice. Furthermore, there is a gre­at need for large-scale anthropometric studi­es in bealthy adults, in particular in the elderly population, in Portugal the correct iden­tification of under-nutrition in individual ca­ses and groups of patients needs to be made.",

Twenty-one patients had normal elec­ tromyographic examinations, and ten of them had normal imagiological studies. Of the re­ maining eleven, only one had imagtological abnormaltties with obvious root compromi­se and a normal EMG (false-negative result). Patients with abnormal EMG's had much more commonly, a pattern of diminished tendon reflexes, segmental weakness and sensory­ motor symptoms, in comparison to the group with normal EMG studies.We conclude that the electromyographic stu­dy can give important information in the eva­luation of patients with suspected lumbo-sa­cral radiculopathy. lt's accessibtlity, low cost and fiability should render it a complemen­tary study of first choice.",

Secondly, the authors' present low molecular weight hepa­rins, which combine easy administration with easy monitorisation, making their total cost lower than that of unfractionated heparin. Caution must be exercised in their implemen­tation, as each low molecular weight heparin has an individual profile that must be asses­sed in each clinical situation. To date, all studies point to a beneficial effect with the use of the various unfractionated heparins in their different clinical settings. lt seems probable that new indications will appear.",

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), also common, has a more aggressive biological behaviour. Ultraviolet radiation (UR) is the most impor­tant epidemiological carcinogenicfactor in the evolution of BCC and SCC. Low phototype patients have a higher incidence of these tumours, which occur, mainly in exposed areas. Chil­dhood sun exposition could be important. The carcinogenic potential of UR is experimentally confirmed. Other kinds of radiation, chemical substances and viruses could also be implica­ted in the aetiopathogenesis. These associati­ons are not yet fully understood. There does not seem to exista sole mechanism which cau­ses a normally diffterentiated keratinocyte to transform into a malignant cell, with the po­ tentialfor local invasion and distant metastases. The way this change occurs still remains almost unknown.",

The General Internist inherited role as mas­ter diagnosttcian-consultant has been largely usurped by technical advances. ln the last years, some policies have been implemented aimed at training General Internists as Primary Care Specialists, and thus artificially restricting thetr clinical activities. These were the two major rea­sons for the decreasing number of General In­ternists and an increasing number of Sub-speci­ality Internists. Another important point is that Internal Medicine doesn't give sufficient outpa­tient experience during the undergraduate me­dical training period, which is a wonderful oppor­tunity to experience the value of Internal Medi­cine as a career of choice. ln the United States, health care evolved into a largely Specialist/Sub­ specialist system and now proves to be more expensive while the outcomes are not clearly bet­ter. The author presents some ideas that he be­ lieves would increase the attractiveness of Ge­neral Internal Medicine.",

Modem medical practice is an ever­ changing process, and the needs of the doctors for information have been partially met by con­tinuous medical education activities, which have been shown not to stop the well-known fact that clinical knowledge, as well as medical practice, deteriorates with time. The busy clinician has two major problems whenfaced with the need to get the most recent and relevant information possi­ble: most of the published medical literature is either irrelevant or not useful and he/she has scarce time left for reading it. EBM can be thou­ght and practiced by physicians with different degrees of autonomy, with several subspecialti­es, working in the hospital or in outpatient cli­nics, alone or in groups.",

The evidence for an auto-immune basis comes from the recognition of insulitis and the presence of multiple auto-antibodies to {3-cell constituents. ln the early pre-clinical phase of type l diabetes, antibodies to islet cell antigens are detected, in­ cluding: lCA (islet cell antibodies), lAA (insulin auto-antibodies) and anti-GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies). The anti-GAD antibody is the main auto-immune marker. When detected in the pre-clinical phase of disease, it allows us to predict future insulin dependency. lts contri­bution to the classification oftype l diabetes in the young non-obese adult and in gestacional diabetes is discussed. ln the future the utilisati­on of anti-GAD could be useful in primary pre­ vention with antigen immunotherapy.",

Several studies have been presented showing the relationship between capillary morphology and the presence of auto-immune diseases. Others, addressed the relationship between specific cha­ racteristics found in essential hypertension, di­abetes and duration of disease. Nevertheless,few quantitative controlled studies have been perfor­med.The authors present a case control study in a population of women with diagnosed auto-im­mune diseases and a population of healthy con­trols.Twenty consecutive women from the Out-pati­ents Clinic of the Auto-immune Diseases Unit, were considered (9 patients with systemic lupus erythe­ matosis (SLE), 7 with systemics sclerosis (SS) and 4 with other auto-immune diseases). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or primary vascular disease were excluded. A po­pulation of 20 healthy, age and sex matched controls was recruited among the hospital staff. Nail­fold capillaroscopy was performed with a video stereomicroscope, and quantitative measurements were evaluated with the use of a metric scale included in the ocular system. The observations were performed in the sarne room, with a stabi­lised temperature. For each patient and control, measurements were made regarding capillary density and diameter, and the presence ofminor or major structural changes. The fagrell index was used to access the global micro-vascular damage.Statistical significance was found with capi­llary density (p<0.003), diameter (p<0.009), and the presence of minor (p<0.001) and major (p<0.002) structural changes, between patients and controls. The fagrell index was also signifl­cantly different ( p< 001). Lupus and systemic sclerosis patients were compared and differen­ces were found regarding major structural chan­ges (p<0.02) and the Fagrell index (p<0.01), with higher values for SS patients.The control group was compared with the SLE patients and the presence of minor structural changes was found more frequently in the Lu­pus group (p<0.0001 ). The other parameters eva­luaded showed no significant difference. The SS patients showed differences regarding the capi­ llary density (p< 0.0001) and diameter (p<0.0001) as well as the presence of major structural chan­ges ( p<0.01).The results highlight the importance of nail­ fold capillaroscopy in the evaluation of patients with auto-immune diseases. The differencesfound are consistent with the micro-vascular involve­ ment in these diseases. The diferent patternfound in SS and in SLE patients, can be explained by the different pachophysiology of these diseases. Fagrell classification canbe an important index to evaluate the severity and evolution of the pa­thological ftndings.",

An increased incidence of right-sided heart dise­ase has emerged, associated with an increasing inci­denceof intravenous drug use.Objective:A retrospective study in patients (Pts) wfth endocardftis, diagnosed using the Duke Endocarditis Service (DES) criteria, was carried out. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated.Population and methods: During the period of May 92 December 1995, 32 Pts (25 male and 7female, with a mean age of  32.5years), had definite diagnostic crite­ ria of END by DES. The clinical course and echocar­ diographic exams were evaluated. Epidemiologic aspects, presentation, aetiological agents, disease evolu­ tionduring hospitaladmission,complications and echocardiographic aspects were analyzed.Results: All patients,exceptone were admitted with fever; 28 patients (27,5%) demonstrated no structural cardiac problem, 2 had congenital cardiac defects and 2 rheumatic valvular disease; 22 patients (68%) were intravenous (LV.) drug users. Staphylococcusaureus was the responsible aetiologlcalagent in 16 cases.Eight patients experienced septic embolic complica­tions (4 pulmonary, 2 splenic 1 digitaland 1cerebral), all patients were LV. drug users.The endocarditis was localized to the tricttspid valve in 20 patients (63%), aortic valve in 8, mitral valve in 6 and the pulmonary valve in 1 patient. The majority had involvement of one cardiac valve only, 3 cases involved multiple valves. Vegetations were singular in 21 patients (66%) and multiple in 7 patients. There were 5 cases of major valvular regurgitation: 3 aortic, 1 mitrat 1 tricuspid and 1 aortic abscess with a shuntfrom the left ventricle to the right atrium Five patients (16%) required surgical correction, with good post-operative outcomes. There was one operative mortality.TTE was diagnostic in31 patients (97%) and TTE was necessary in 4 patientsfor further evaluation namely persistent fever or hemodynamic compromise.Conclusions: 1)- This study revealed a predominan­ce of right-sided endocarditis in young LV. drug users without pre-existent tricuspid valvular disease, with a 25% incidence of septic embolization.

The following con­clusions were reached:BD is a condition of early onset, usually between the 2nd and 4th decades of life (average age of onset from ftrst symptom = 25,8 ± 11,1 years). Recurrent episodes of oral ulceration is the presenting mani­festation in 78% of cases. Ocular involvement is the most disabling complication, being observed in 74% of cases. Of these, 80% present with bilateral involve­ment, with permanent sequelae in 52%. Cutaneous findings are observed in 82%, with pseudofolliculitis found in 62% of the total. Genital apthae were obser­ved in 80% of cases. A positive pathergy test was dis­played in 40%. Joint disturbances, not a diagnostic criterion, was the flrst clinical finding in 7% of all ca­ses. As a whole, 85% of patients showed some joint involvement. The clinical diagnosis of BDis late (7,0 ± 7,5 years), but there is an inevitable delay in diagno­sis of 4,0 ± 4,7years (range: 0-21), dueto the need to obtain and associate the necessary diagnostic crite­ria. Recurrent oral ulceration is afrequent flnding in family members of BD patients, being observed in 42% of first and second degree relatives. HIA B5 is found positive in 60% of cases, deflning a relative risk of 5. ln all B5 positive cases, in whom B51 was tested,100%, had a positive result.",

Corticosteroid therapy was given to 30 pa­tients, 9 achived complete remission; 4 of those were in continuous complete remission; 15 patients had partial remission and 6 failed to achieve a respon­se. 14 patients received gammaglobins intra-venously; 1 achived complete remission; 9 had parti­al remission and 6 had no response. Only 4 patients were splenectomized; 2 achi­ved complete remission; other were lost for to follow-up.Four patients were treated with azothioprine; 3 achi­ved partial remission and 1 patient had no response. Danazol was used in 2 patients with no beneftcial effect.. Median follow-up for 24 months revealed: 13 patients had multiple relapses, 4 achieved continuous complete remission and 1 died; 12 pati­ents were lost to follow-up.Conclusions: Corticosteroid therapy was the most effective therapy in ITP, with 30% of pattents achieving com­plete remisston in our study.ln spite of the many different treatment regi­mes available, 43% of patients had a chronic disease evolution, in accord with the international ITP disease statistics.",

We describe here a coloured patient with HIV infection who presented with nephrotic syndrome. The patient exhibited a massive form of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinacemia (IgG 71 g/l) and the renal biopsy showed a focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis.

The initial approach should be non invasive and consist of a careful clinical history and examination, the analysis of the urinary se­diment and the renal ultrasound. The uncertainty about the etiological diagnosis and the need to correctly assess the degree of renal insufficiency determine the need to perform a renal biop­sy. The most important clinical aspects are due to failure to excrete nitrogenous products, volu­me and salt overload.",

We analysed: age and sex; types of CVD and temporal profile; VRF (previous AVC, hypertension (HT), diabetes, dyslipidemia, heart disease, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption); morbility and morta­ lity; blood pressure (BP), complete blood count, glucose and lipid analysis at admission.Patients: 65 patients were young adults (YA) and 309 were old (Od).Results: The CVD in YA represented 14% and in Od 66.7% of ali CVD admitted; male were more prevalent in YA (52.3%) and female in Od (58.3%). The most frequent type of CVD was ischemic (IS) (82.8% in YA and 82.1% in Od) with the lacunar sub-type more prevalent in YA (P-0.04) and the atherothrombotic in Od (P=0.004); TIA represen­ ted 8.3% of IS in YA and 3.3% in Od Previous stroke were reported in 20% YA and 32.7% Od (P=0.04). The dyslipidemia (43.1%), heavy alchool con­ sumption (24.6%) and cigarette smoking (12.3%) were more preval,ent in YA. There was heart dise­ase in 36.9% YA and 52.4% Od (P=0.02); the valvu­lar cardio-pathy was more prevalent in YA (18.5%). Infeccious complications were observed in 32.1% YA and 58.3% Od (P=0.001). The YA ha­ved a good improvement (slight deficits in 56.8% YA vs 28.3% Od - P=0.001). The mortality rate in YA was 12.3% and in Od 30.4% (P=0.003).Conclusions: The preval,ence of CVD in YA was 14 %. We observed more prevalence of female in olders. The IS was the more frequent stroke in both groups, the lacunar sub-type was more fre­quent in YA and the atherothrombotic in Od The HT was the more frequent VRF in both groups. The valvular cardiopathy was more frequent in YA and atrial fibrillation in Od The morbility and mortality was higher in older patients. ln admis­sion the mean level of dyastolic BP, total choleste­rol, LDL-C and triglycerides were significantly higher in YA.",

The following parameters were analysed: number of admissions per patient, time of permanence in the hospital, opportunistic complications, final outcome, medical counselling at leaving and dis­tribution according to sex, age, ethnic, infectious virus, risk group and staging.From the results one can highlight the following: 61 patients were admitted, with a total of 134 ad­missions: 20 in 1992, 35 in 1993, 60 in 1994 and 19 during the first semester of 1995. 57% of the pati­ents were drugs addicts and the most frequent opportunistic infection was tuberculosis. Of the 202 opportunistic complications observed, we could reach an accurate diagnosis in 47,6% of the cases. The average time of permanence in the hos­pital was 15,8 days. Mortality was 10% and 94% of the patients were sent to the outpatient clinic of Infectious Diseases. The authors tried to ma­tch the results with the social and economical si­tuation, comparing them with other national ca­suisty.The authors conclusion is that the HIV infecti­on is more and more an important reason of ad­mission, even in District Hospitals and in Inter­nal Medicine Wards.",

The 2 groups were com­ pared and the single prognostic factor was the ingested quantity of paraquat. Dyspnea, oliguria and jaundice were the clinical manifestations with prognostic value, while values of LDH, AST and pO2 (at admission on Urgency Room) were also prognostic indicators.

Its manifestations are: fluctuation of the state of awareness, disturbance of the sleep­ awake cyde, deficit of attention and concentrati­on, disorganized thought that originates incohe­rent speech, disturbances of perception like illu­sions and/or hallucinations, disorientation in time and space, agitation or reduced psychomo­tor activity and disturbed memory. The major causes of delirium in the /CU are: systemic and metabolic diseases, for instance sepsis, renal fai­lure and hepatic failure; exogenous toxic agents, e.g. some drugs; withdrawal from substances upon which the patient has become dependent, like alcohol; and primary intracranial diseases such as infections of the central nervous system. Other factors often coexist like sleep deprivati­on, previous cognitive deficits, fear, anxiety and the patient's personality. Treatment comprises the correction of metabolic and systemic disturban­ces, the suspension of toxics and/or the use of antidotes, the withdrawal treatment, the use of haloperidol and benzodiazepines, and non-phar­ macological actions that reduce the environmen­tal stress and promote the physical and mental well-being.",

Medicine is not properly a science, but a scientifi­cally founded profession wich deals with indivi­dual cases of undefinable variety. To mathematize Medicine is attempting but faces great limitations. Statistics, the branch of mathematics more closely linked to medical activities, is very useful to define trends. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that statistical antecipations will in fact happen, in a indi­vidual case.Additionally to this limitation of intrinsic natu­re, one must be aware of formal errors, abusive interpretations, difficulties in reading results, di­fferences of conclusions in dependence of metho­ds, and many other problems. Clinical decision must consider statistical data, among several other sour­ces of information. However, the global sense of the doctor will never be replaced by the myth of an abstract and unexpressive list of figures. A diag­nostic procedure, a therapeutic approach, the dis­closure of the prognosis are always personal choi­ces. The physician makes his option having in mind the complex problematic of an individual patient, wich is by no means possible to simplify in a for­mula or an equation.",

A new physician-patient re­lationship has emerged in which the physician is not the central player anymore. Reflection is clearly needed on the new bioethical and huma­nistic values in this relationship. According to the Author, the physician should recover the role as an advisor. ln the future as it is easily predicta­ble, besides the physician's responsability towar­ds he patient, he will also be more responsable for the cost-benefit ratio of medical care within the society. It is theref ore mandatory to nurture the physician-patient relationship the essence of the art of medicine.",

The parameters that had been analyzed were: sex, age, clinicai manifesta­ tions, medical treatment and clinicai course.The female sex was predominant (73,3%) and the average age of the group was 56 years. All the pati­ents presented articular manifestations and in 40% of the cases revealed extra-articular manifestations. The assessment of the therapy performed (gold compounds, methotrexate, d-penicillamine) allowed to conclude that methotrexate was the drug which had a better clinical response and less toxicity.From the review of literature about RA the au­ thors point out the need of the earlier use of more aggressive drugs, probably in combinations, which can prevent the eventual loss of joint structure and function and increase the life span of the patients.",

From the obtained results they underline: A) The therapi­ es used were: hydratation only (n = 27) and associ­ ated with drugs (n = 18), include always furosemi­de), {corticoids ( n = 6), calcitonin ( n = 9), bisphos­ phonates (n = 12)}.

C) The regression of the symptomatology was more consi­derable in the group that used bisphosphonates. ln the patients subjected to the therapy, there was temporary control of calcemia, more relevant with various drugs in association. ln a third of the pati­ents that used bisphosphonates or calcitonin there was an ease of pain. D) The death rate in hospitali­zation and delay was about twice more than the total of the hospitalized patients.Conclusions: 1) Significant predominance of the metabolic disturbance (26%) in the solid neoplasms.2) The hypercalcemia was valorized being subjec­ted to the therapeutic measures besides the hydra­tion 40% of the patients. 3) The therapeuic option was more specifically based on the leveis of calce­mia rather than on the symptoms, and the bone metastization influenced the use of calcitonin and bisphosphonates. 4) The symptomatic improvement in a significant number of patients and the tempo­ rary control of the leveis of calcium, are factors which improved the quality of life of these patients, counter balacing them until measures of basis are adopted, what occurred in a third ofthe cases.",

As reasons for the buest performance, the authors point out a correct and prompt diagnosis, the use of a monoantibiotic drug regimen, mainly with the betalaclamic drugs, as well as the control of metabolic, water and eletrolitics disorders. The autors also point out that Sfreptococcos Pneumoniae was the most commun agent isolated, as reported in the bibliography.

The decrease of blood pressure has proved to reduce the hypertensive ( mechanical) complications of hypertension but it did not prevent myocardial infarction, an atheros­ clerotic complication, as expected by the results of the epidemiological studies. ln addition, it is not clear the real effect of antihypertensive therapy in the prevention of ischemic cerebrovascular acci­dents. Both situations are the result of thrombotic events and are straightly related to endothelial function, platelet aggregation, fibrinolytic system and coagulation.ln the last ten years it was demonstrated that increased platelet aggregation and decreased fi­brinolytic activity are dysfunctions related to hypertension. They appear to be independent ma­rkers of hypertension and not a consequence of the increased blood pressure.Blood pressure normalisation with diuretics and beta-blockers, the main therapies used in the big trials, failed to normalise those dysfunctions, unaffecting the action of factors with a crucial role in atherogenesis and thrombogenesis.The introduction of new antihypertensive thera­pies, which decrease platelet aggregation and in­ crease fibrinolytic activity, permit us to question if with their utilisation will it be possible to pre­vent the atherosclerotic complications of arterial hypertension.",

They have a broad spectrum of activity. They are highly active against Enterobacteriaceae and also active against some strains of Pseudo­monas aeruginosa and Staphilococcus sp., howe­ver recent reports indicate increasing resistance. They have poor activity against streptococci and anaerobes. These agents exhibited excelknt oral absorption, good tissue distribution and are excreted primarily by way of the kidney. The inci­dence of adverse effects to fluoroquinolones appe­ars to be low. The most common are gastrointesti­ nal reactions, followed by central nervous system disorders. Hypersensivity reactions occur occa­sionally. Fluoroquinolones interact with a number of other agents, with potential clinicai manifesta­tions, such as antacids, theophylline, warf arine. The bioavailability after oral administration allows the use of these agents without loss of effi­cacity, when compared with IV administration, thus reducing substantially the treatment cost.",

The clinical and epidemiological characteris­tics of the 54 patients (HIV1 - 46 and HIV2 - 8) as well as some diagnostic aspects of the opportunistic infections and of the antiviral therapy options are presented. We analyse the evolution of the patients throughout a medium follow-up period of two and halfyears as well as the significant impact in terms of hospital admissions. Emphasis is given to the motiva­tion and collaboration of all the health profes­sionals to face the difficult clinical problems of these patients in the context of an Internal Medicine Unit. Finally the role of the Internist in the health care of patients with HIV infecti­on is discussed and we argue in favour of a direct and continuous involvement of these specialists in all stages of the natural history of the disease.",

From our experience, gravity scores such as APACHE II, SAPS I or TISS although useful in this pathology, are not totally effective in predicting a fatal ou­tcome. With the purpose of improving the predictive power of those scores, we conducted a retrospective study of 143 patients admitted at U.U.M.. Using appropriate statistical methods, two gravity scores were built: the first one used 16 items obtained at admittance to the ICU, and the second one was based upon 13 clinical and therapeutic items obtained during the time spent at the ICU. Patients were stratified in three risk groups according to the individual score result (Scorel <19 - mortality: 4%, Scorel between 19 and 33 - mortality: 30%; Score1 >33 - mortality: 94%). Two groups of high prognostic value for a fatal outcome ( sensitivity: 93% and specificity: 87%) were defined by the use ofthe second score. Score2 (Score2 <14 - mortality: 4%; Score2 >= 14 mortality: 78%). The use of both scores (1 and 2) revealed a more accurate predictive power of a fatal outcome than APACHE II, SAPS I or TISS. Score2 strengthened the predictive power of Sco­rd, mainly on those patients with intermediate risk prognosis at admission. Using Scores 1 and 2 altogether, we found a predictive result of ou­tcome in 89% of all patients.",
